  content: "\n  I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable\nrobustness
    entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back\nupon admitting him,
    a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the\ncongregation, sufficiently attested
    that this fine old man was the\nchaplain. Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple,
    so called by the\nwhalemen, among whom he was a very great favorite. He had been
    a\nsailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had\ndedicated
    his life to the ministry. At the time I now write of, Father\nMapple was in the
    hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort of\nold age which seems merging
    into a second flowering youth, for among\nall the fissures of his wrinkles, there
    shone certain mild gleams of a\nnewly developing bloom- the spring verdure peeping
    forth even\nbeneath February's snow. No one having previously heard his history,\ncould
    for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost\ninterest, because
    there were certain engrafted clerical\npeculiarities about him, imputable to
    that adventurous maritime life\nhe had led. When he entered I observed that he
    carried no umbrella,\nand certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin
    hat\nran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed\nalmost
    to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had\nabsorbed. However,
    hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed,\nand hung up in a little
    space in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed\nin a decent suit, he quietly approached
    the pulpit.\n  Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and\nsince
    a regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle\nwith the floor, seriously
    contract the already small area of the\nchapel, the architect, it seemed, had
    acted upon the hint of Father\nMapple, and finished the pulpit without a stairs,
    substituting a\nperpendicular side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship
    from a\nboat at sea. The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel\nwith
    a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder,\nwhich, being itself
    nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany\ncolor, the whole contrivance, considering
    what manner of chapel it\nwas, seemed by no means in bad taste. Halting for an
    instant at the\nfoot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental\nknobs
    of the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then\nwith a truly sailor-like
    but still reverential dexterity, hand over\nhand, mounted the steps as if ascending
    the main-top of his vessel.\n  The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as
    is usually the\ncase with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the
    rounds\nwere of wood, so that at every step there was a joint. At my first\nglimpse
    of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient\nfor a ship, these
    joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.\nFor I was not prepared to
    see Father Mapple after gaining the\nheight, slowly turn round, and stooping
    over the pulpit,\ndeliberately drag up the ladder step by step, till the whole
    was\ndeposited within, leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec.\n  I pondered
    some time without fully comprehending the reason for\nthis. Father Mapple enjoyed
    such a wide reputation for sincerity and\nsanctity, that I could not suspect
    him of courting notoriety by any\nmere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there
    must be some sober\nreason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something\nunseen.
    Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he\nsignifies his spiritual
    withdrawal for the time, from all outward\nworldly ties and connexions? Yes,
    for replenished with the meat and\nwine of the word, to the faithful man of God,
    this pulpit, I see, is a\nself-containing stronghold- a lofty Ehrenbreitstein,
    with a\nperennial well of water within the walls.\n  But the side ladder was
    not the only strange feature of the place,\nborrowed from the chaplain's former
    sea-farings. Between the marble\ncenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the
    wall which formed its back\nwas adorned with a large painting representing a
    gallant ship\nbeating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks
    and\nsnowy breakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling\nclouds,
    there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed\nforth an angel's
    face; and this bright face shed a distant spot of\nradiance upon the ship's tossed
    deck, something like that silver plate\nnow inserted into Victory's plank where
    Nelson fell. \"Ah, noble ship,\"\nthe angel seemed to say, \"beat on, beat on,
    thou noble ship, and\nbear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through;
    the clouds are\nrolling off- serenest azure is at hand.\"\n  Nor was the pulpit
    itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\nhad achieved the ladder and
    the picture. Its panelled front was in the\nlikeness of a ship's bluff bows,
    and the Holy Bible rested on a\nprojecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after
    a ship's\nfiddle-headed beak.\n  What could be more full of meaning?- for the
    pulpit is ever this\nearth's foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the
    pulpit\nleads the world. From thence it is the storm of God's quick wrath is\nfirst
    descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From\nthence it is the God
    of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for\nfavorable winds. Yes, the world's
    a ship on its passage out, and not a\nvoyage complete; and the pulpit is its
    prow.\n  "
