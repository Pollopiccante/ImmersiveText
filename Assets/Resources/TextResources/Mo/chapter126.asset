  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 127,   The Deck
  content: "\n  What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times,\nhe
    was to me, as yet remains unsaid.\n  Aside from those more obvious considerations
    touching Moby Dick,\nwhich could not but occasionally awaken in any man's soul
    some\nalarm, there was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror\nconcerning
    him, which at times by its intensity completely overpowered\nall the rest; and
    yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that\nI almost despair of putting
    it in a comprehensible form. It was the\nwhiteness of the whale that above all
    things appalled me. But how\ncan I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some
    dim, random way,\nexplain myself I must, else all these chapters might be naught.\n 
    Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances\nbeauty, as if
    imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles,\njaponicas, and pearls;
    and though various nations have in some way\nrecognised a certain royal preeminence
    in this hue; even the barbaric,\ngrand old kings of Pegu placing the title \"Lord
    of the White\nElephants\" above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion;\nand
    the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped\nin the royal
    standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one\nfigure of a snow-white charger;
    and the great Austrian Empire,\nCaesarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for
    the imperial color the\nsame imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it
    applies to the\nhuman race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership over
    every\ndusky tribe; and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been even\nmade
    significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone\nmarked a joyful
    day; and though in other mortal sympathies and\nsymbolizings, this same hue is
    made the emblem of many touching, noble\nthings- the innocence of brides, the
    benignity of age; though among\nthe Red Men of America the giving of the white
    belt of wampum was\nthe deepest pledge of honor; though in many climes, whiteness
    typifies\nthe majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and contributes\nto
    the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds;\nthough even
    in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it\nhas been made the symbol
    of the divine spotlessness and power; by\nthe Persian fire worshippers, the white
    forked flame being held the\nholiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies,
    Great Jove himself\nbeing made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and though to
    the noble\nIroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far\nthe
    holiest festival of their theology, that spotless, faithful\ncreature being held
    the purest envoy they could send to the Great\nSpirit with the annual tidings
    of their own fidelity; and though\ndirectly from the Latin word for white, all
    Christian priests derive\nthe name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb
    or tunic, worn\nbeneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish\nfaith,
    white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion\nof our Lord; though
    in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given\nto the redeemed, and the four-and-twenty
    elders stand clothed in white\nbefore the great-white throne, and the Holy One
    that sitteth there\nwhite like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations,
    with\nwhatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an\nelusive
    something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes\nmore of panic to
    the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.\n  This elusive quality
    it is, which causes the thought of whiteness,\nwhen divorced from more kindly
    associations, and coupled with any\nobject terrible in itself, to heighten that
    terror to the furthest\nbounds. Witness the white bear of the poles, and the
    white shark of\nthe tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them
    the\ntranscendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which\nimparts
    such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific,\nto the dumb gloating
    of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged\ntiger in his heraldic coat can
    so stagger courage as the\nwhite-shrouded bear or shark.*\n\n  *With reference
    to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him\nwho would fain go still deeper
    into this matter, that it is not the\nwhiteness, separately regarded, which heightens
    the intolerable\nhideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness,\nit
    might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the\nirresponsible ferociousness
    of the creature stands invested in the\nfleece of celestial innocence and love;
    and hence, by bringing\ntogether two such opposite emotions in our minds, the
    Polar bear\nfrightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all\nthis
    to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not\nhave that intensified
    terror.\n  As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in\nthat
    creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies\nwith the same
    quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most\nvividly hit by the
    French in the name they bestow upon that fish.\nThe Romish mass for the dead
    begins with \"Requiem eternam\" (eternal\nrest), whence Requiem denominating
    the mass itself, and any other\nfuneral music. Now, in allusion to the white,
    silent stillness of\ndeath in this shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits,
    the French\ncall him Requin.\n\n  Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come
    those clouds of spiritual\nwonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom
    sails in all\nimaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God's great,\nunflattering
    laureate, Nature.*\n\n  *I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during
    a\nprolonged gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my\nforenoon
    watch below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there,\ndashed upon the
    main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of\nunspotted whiteness, and with
    a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At\nintervals, it arched forth its vast archangel
    wings, as if to\nembrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook
    it.\nThough bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king's ghost in\nsupernatural
    distress. Through its inexpressible, strange eyes,\nmethought I peeped to secrets
    which took hold of God. As Abraham\nbefore the angels, I bowed myself; the white
    thing was so white, its\nwings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters,
    I had lost the\nmiserable warping memories of traditions and of towns. Long I
    gazed at\nthat prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the things that\ndarted
    through me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a\nsailor what bird
    was this. A goney, he replied. Goney! never had heard\nthat name before; is it
    conceivable that this glorious thing is\nutterly unknown to men ashore! never!
    But some time after, I learned\nthat goney was some seaman's name for albatross.
    So that by no\npossibility could Coleridge's wild Rhyme have had aught to do
    with\nthose mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird\nupon
    our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the\nbird to be an
    albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly\nburnish a little brighter
    the noble merit of the poem and the poet.\n  I assert, then, that in the wondrous
    bodily whiteness of the bird\nchiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth
    the more evinced in\nthis, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called
    grey\nalbatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such\nemotions
    as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.\n  But how had the mystic thing been caught?
    Whisper it not, and I will\ntell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl
    floated on the\nsea. At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered,\nleathern
    tally round its neck, with the ship's time and place; and\nthen letting it escape.
    But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant\nfor man, was taken off in Heaven,
    when the white fowl flew to join the\nwing-folding, the invoking, and adoring
    cherubim!\n\n  Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that
    of\nthe White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,\nlarge-eyed,
    small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a\nthousand monarchs in
    his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the\nelected Xerxes of vast herds of
    wild horses, whose pastures in those\ndays were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains
    and the Alleghanies. At\ntheir flaming head he westward trooped it like that
    chosen star\nwhich every evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing\ncascade
    of his mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him\nwith housings more
    resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have\nfurnished him. A most imperial
    and archangelical apparition of that\nunfallen, western world, which to the eyes
    of the old trappers and\nhunters revived the glories of those primeval times
    when Adam walked\nmajestic as a god, bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty
    steed.\nWhether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless\ncohorts
    that endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or\nwhether with his
    circumambient subjects browsing all around at the\nhorizon, the White Steed gallopingly
    reviewed them with warm\nnostrils reddening through his cool milkiness; in whatever
    aspect he\npresented himself, always to the bravest Indians he was the object\nof
    trembling reverence and awe. Nor can it be questioned from what\nstands on legendary
    record of this noble horse, that it was his\nspiritual whiteness chiefly, which
    so clothed him with divineness; and\nthat this divineness had that in it which,
    though commanding\nworship, at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror.\n 
    But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that\naccessory
    and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and\nAlbatross.\n  What
    is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often\nshocks the eye,
    as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and\nkin! It is that whiteness
    which invests him, a thing expressed by\nthe name he bears. The Albino is as
    well made as other men- has no\nsubstantive deformity- and yet this mere aspect
    of all-pervading\nwhiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest\nabortion.
    Why should this be so?\n  Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least
    palpable but\nnot the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces\nthis
    crowning attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the\ngauntleted ghost
    of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White\nSquall. Nor, in some historic
    instances, has the art of human malice\nomitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly
    it heightens the effect\nof that passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy
    symbol of\ntheir faction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff\nin
    the market-place!\n  Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience
    of all\nmankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It\ncannot
    well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect\nof the dead which
    most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor\nlingering there; as if indeed that
    pallor were as much like the\nbadge of consternation in the other world, as of
    mortal trepidation\nhere. And from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive
    hue\nof the shroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions\ndo we
    fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all\nghosts rising in
    a milk-white fog- Yea, while these terrors seize\nus, let us add, that even the
    king of terrors, when personified by the\nevangelist, rides on his pallid horse.\n 
    Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or\ngracious thing he
    will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its\nprofoundest idealized significance
    it calls up a peculiar apparition\nto the soul.\n  But though without dissent
    this point be fixed, how is mortal man to\naccount for it? To analyze it, would
    seem impossible. Can we, then, by\nthe citation of some of those instances wherein
    this thing of\nwhiteness- though for the time either wholly or in great part
    stripped\nof all direct associations calculated to import to it aught fearful,\nbut
    nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same sorcery,\nhowever modified;-
    can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue\nto conduct us to the hidden
    cause we seek?\n  Let us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to
    subtlety,\nand without imagination no man can follow another into these halls.\nAnd
    though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions\nabout to be
    presented may have been shared by most men, yet few\nperhaps were entirely conscious
    of them at the time, and therefore may\nnot be able to recall them now.\n  Why
    to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but\nloosely acquainted with
    the peculiar character of the day, does the\nbare mention of Whitsuntide marshal
    in the fancy such long, dreary,\nspeechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims,
    down-cast and hooded\nwith new-fallen snow? Or to the unread, unsophisticated
    Protestant\nof the Middle American States, why does the passing mention of a
    White\nFriar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?\n  Or
    what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and\nkings (which
    will not wholly account for it) that makes the White\nTower of London tell so
    much more strongly on the imagination of an\nuntravelled American, than those
    other storied structures, its\nneighbors- the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody?
    And those sublimer\ntowers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in
    peculiar\nmoods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare\nmention
    of that name, while the thought of Virginia's Blue Ridge is\nfull of a soft,
    dewy, distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of\nall latitudes and longitudes,
    does the name of the White Sea exert\nsuch a spectralness over the fancy, while
    that of the Yellow Sea lulls\nus with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild
    afternoons on the\nwaves, followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets?
    Or, to\nchoose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the fancy,\nwhy,
    in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does \"the\ntall pale man\"
    of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor\nunrustlingly glides through the
    green of the groves- why is this\nphantom more terrible than all the whooping
    imps of the Blocksburg?\n  Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling\nearthquakes;
    nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the\ntearlessness of and skies that
    never rain; nor the sight of her wide\nfield of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones,
    and crosses all\nadroop (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban\navenues
    of house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of\ncards;- it is
    not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the\nstrangest, saddest city
    thou can'st see. For Lima has taken the\nwhite veil; and there is a higher horror
    in this whiteness of her woe.\nOld as Pizarro, this whiteness keeps her ruins
    for ever new; admits\nnot the cheerful greenness of complete decay; spreads over
    her\nbroken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own\ndistortions.\n 
    I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of\nwhiteness is not
    confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the\nterror of objects otherwise
    terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is\nthere aught of terror in those appearances
    whose awfulness to\nanother mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon,
    especially\nwhen exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or\nuniversality.
    What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be\nrespectively elucidated by
    the following examples.\n  First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of
    foreign lands,\nif by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance,
    and\nfeels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but\nunder
    precisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his\nhammock to view
    his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky\nwhiteness- as if from encircling
    headlands shoals of combed white\nbears were swimming round him, then he feels
    a silent, superstitious\ndread; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is
    horrible to\nhim as a real ghost; in vain the lead assures him he is still off\nsoundings;
    heart and helm they both go down; he never rests till\nblue water is under him
    again. Yet where is the mariner who will\ntell thee, \"Sir, it was not so much
    the fear of striking hidden rocks,\nas the fear of that hideous whiteness that
    so stirred me?\"\n  Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight
    of the\nsnowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the\nmere
    fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such\nvast altitudes,
    and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would\nbe to lose oneself in
    such inhuman solitude. Much the same is it\nwith the backwoodsman of the West,
    who with comparative indifference\nviews an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven
    snow, no shadow of tree\nor twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not
    so the sailor,\nbeholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times,
    by some\ninfernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he,\nshivering
    and half shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope\nand solace to his misery,
    views what seems a boundless churchyard\ngrinning upon him with its lean ice
    monuments and splintered crosses.\n  But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead
    chapter about whiteness is\nbut a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou
    surrenderest to a\nhypo, Ishmael.\n  Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled
    in some peaceful\nvalley of Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey- why
    is it that\nupon the sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind\nhim,
    so that he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal\nmuskiness- why
    will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the\nground in phrensies of
    affright? There is no remembrance in him of any\ngorings of wild creatures in
    his green northern home, so that the\nstrange muskiness he smells cannot recall
    to him anything associated\nwith the experience of former perils; for what knows
    he, this New\nEngland colt, of the black bisons of distant Oregon?\n  No; but
    here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of\nthe knowledge of the
    demonism in the world. Though thousands of\nmiles from Oregon, still when he
    smells that savage musk, the rending,\ngoring bison herds are as present as to
    the deserted wild foal of\nthe prairies, which this instant they may be trampling
    into dust.\n  Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings\nof
    the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the\nwindrowed snows
    of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking\nof that buffalo robe
    to the frightened colt!\n  Though neither knows where lie the nameless things
    of which the\nmystic sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt,\nsomewhere
    those things must exist. Though in many of its aspects\nthis visible world seems
    formed in love, the invisible spheres were\nformed in fright.\n  But not yet
    have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and\nlearned why it appeals
    with such power to the soul; and more strange\nand far more portentous- why,
    as we have seen, it is at once the\nmost meaning symbol of spiritual things,
    nay, the very veil of the\nChristian's Deity; and yet should be as it is, the
    intensifying\nagent in things the most appalling to mankind.\n  Is it that by
    its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless\nvoids and immensities of the
    universe, and thus stabs us from behind\nwith the thought of annihilation, when
    beholding the white depths of\nthe milky way? Or is it, that as in essence whiteness
    is not so much a\ncolor as the visible absence of color; and at the same time
    the\nconcrete of all colors; is it for these reasons that there is such a\ndumb
    blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows- a\ncolorless, all-color
    of atheism from which we shrink? And when we\nconsider that other theory of the
    natural philosophers, that all other\nearthly hues- every stately or lovely emblazoning-
    the sweet tinges of\nsunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies,\nand
    the butterfly cheeks of young girls; all these are but subtile\ndeceits, not
    actually inherent in substances, but only laid on from\nwithout; so that all
    deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot,\nwhose allurements cover nothing
    but the charnel-house within; and when\nwe proceed further, and consider that
    the mystical cosmetic which\nproduces every one of her hues, the great principle
    of light, for ever\nremains white or colorless in itself, and if operating without\nmedium
    upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips and roses,\nwith its own blank
    tinge- pondering all this, the palsied universe\nlies before us a leper; and
    like wilful travellers in Lapland, who\nrefuse to wear colored and coloring glasses
    upon their eyes, so the\nwretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental
    white shroud\nthat wraps all the prospect around him. And of all these things
    the\nAlbino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?\n  "
