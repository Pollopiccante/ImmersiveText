  content: "\n The cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out.\n\n 
    I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where'er\nI sail.
    The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let\nthem; but first I
    pass.\n  Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet's rim, the warm waves blush like\nwine.
    The gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun- slow dived from\nnoon- goes down;
    my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill.\nIs, then, the crown too
    heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of\nLombardy. Yet is it bright with many a
    gem; I the wearer, see not\nits far flashings; but darkly feel that I wear that,
    that dazzlingly\nconfounds. 'Tis iron- that I know- not gold. 'Tis split, too-
    that I\nfeel; the jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat against\nthe
    solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the sort that needs no helmet\nin the most
    brain-battering fight!\n  Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise
    nobly\nspurred me, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it\nlights
    not me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne'er\nenjoy. Gifted with
    the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying\npower; damned, most subtly and
    most malignantly! damned in the midst\nof Paradise! Good night-good night! (waving
    his hand, he moves from\nthe window.)\n  'Twas not so hard a task. I thought
    to find one stubborn, at the\nleast; but my one cogged circle fits into all their
    various wheels,\nand they revolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of
    powder,\nthey all stand before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire\nothers,
    the match itself must needs be wasting! What I've dared,\nI've willed; and what
    I've willed, I'll do! They think me mad-\nStarbuck does; but I'm demoniac, I
    am madness maddened! That wild\nmadness that's only calm to comprehend itself!
    The prophecy was that I\nshould be dismembered; and- Aye! I lost this leg. I
    now prophesy\nthat I will dismember my dismemberer. Now, then, be the prophet
    and\nthe fulfiller one. That's more than ye, ye great gods, ever were. I\nlaugh
    and hoot at ye, ye cricket-players, ye pugilists, ye deaf Burkes\nand blinded
    Bendigoes! I will not say as schoolboys do to bullies-\nTake some one of your
    own size; don't pommel me! No, ye've knocked\nme down, and I am up again; but
    ye have run and hidden. Come forth\nfrom behind your cotton bags! I have no long
    gun to reach ye. Come,\nAhab's compliments to ye; come and see if ye can swerve
    me. Swerve me?\nye cannot swerve me, else ye swerve yourselves! man has ye there.\nSwerve
    me? The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails,\nwhereon my soul is
    grooved to run. Over unsounded gorges, through\nthe rifled hearts of mountains,
    under torrents' beds, unerringly I\nrush! Naught's an obstacle, naught's an angle
    to the iron way!\n  "
