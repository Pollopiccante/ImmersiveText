  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 49,   The Hyena
  content: "\n  In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise
    and\nno small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been\ndiligently
    consulting Yojo- the name of his black little god- and Yojo\nhad told him two
    or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it\neveryway, that instead of
    our going together among the whaling-fleet\nin harbor, and in concert selecting
    our craft; instead of this, I say,\nYojo earnestly enjoined that the selection
    of the ship should rest\nwholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending
    us; and, in\norder to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left
    to\nmyself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as\nthough
    it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must\nimmediately ship myself,
    for the present irrespective of Queequeg.\n  I have forgotten to mention that,
    in many things, Queequeg placed\ngreat confidence in the excellence of Yojo's
    judgment and surprising\nforecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable
    esteem, as\na rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the\nwhole,
    but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.\n  Now, this plan
    of Queequeg's or rather Yojo's, touching the\nselection of our craft; I did not
    like that plan at all. I had not a\nlittle relied upon Queequeg's sagacity to
    point out the whaler best\nfitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But
    as all my\nremonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to\nacquiesce;
    and accordingly prepared to set about this business with\na determined rushing
    sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly\nsettle that trifling little affair.
    Next morning early, leaving\nQueequeg shut up with in our little bedroom- for
    it seemed that it was\nsome sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation,
    and\nprayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; how it was I never could\nfind out,
    for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never\ncould master his liturgies
    and XXXIX Articles- leaving Queequeg, then,\nfasting on his tomahawk pipe, and
    Yojo warming himself at his\nsacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among
    the shipping.\nAfter much prolonged sauntering, and many random inquiries, I
    learnt\nthat there were three ships up for three-years' voyages- The\nDevil-dam,
    the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. Devil-dam, I do not know the\norigin of; Tit-bit
    is obvious; Pequod you will no doubt remember,\nwas the name of a celebrated
    tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now\nextinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and
    pryed about the\nDevil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally,
    going on\nboard the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided\nthat
    this was the very ship for us.\n  You may have seen many a quaint craft in your
    day, for aught I\nknow;- square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box\ngalliots,
    and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such\na rare old craft as
    this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the\nold school, rather small if
    anything; with an old-fashioned\nclaw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and
    weather-stained in the\ntyphoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull's
    complexion was\ndarkened like a French grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt\nand
    Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts- cut\nsomewhere on the
    coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost\noverboard in a gale- her masts
    stood stiffly up like the spines of the\nthree old kings of Cologne. Her ancient
    decks were worn and\nwrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury\nCathedral
    where Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities,\nwere added new and
    marvellous features, pertaining to the wild\nbusiness that for more than half
    a century she had followed. Old\nCaptain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before
    he commanded\nanother vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of
    the\nprincipal owners of the Pequod,- this old Peleg, during the term of\nhis
    chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and\ninlaid it, all
    over, with a quaintness both of material and device,\nunmatched by anything except
    it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or\nbedstead. She was apparelled like any
    barbaric Ethiopian emperor,\nhis neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory.
    She was a thing of\ntrophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in
    the\nchased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open\nbulwarks were
    garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp\nteeth of the sperm whale,
    inserted there for pins, to fasten her old\nhempen thews and tendons to. Those
    thews ran not through base blocks\nof land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves
    of sea-ivory. Scorning\na turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there
    a tiller;\nand that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow\nlower
    jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered that\ntiller in a tempest,
    felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his\nfiery steed by clutching its jaw.
    A noble craft, but somehow a most\nmelancholy! All noble things are touched with
    that.\n  Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having\nauthority,
    in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage,\nat first I saw nobody;
    but I could not well overlook a strange sort of\ntent, or rather wigwam, pitched
    a little behind the main-mast. It\nseemed only a temporary erection used in port.
    It was of a conical\nshape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge
    slabs of\nlimber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws\nof
    the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a\ncircle of these
    slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each\nother, and at the apex united
    in a tufted point, where the loose hairy\nfibres waved to and fro like the top-knot
    on some old Pottowottamie\nSachem's head. A triangular opening faced towards
    the bows of the\nship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.\n 
    And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who\nby his
    aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and\nthe ship's work
    suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of\ncommand. He was seated
    on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling\nall over with curious carving; and
    the bottom of which was formed of a\nstout interlacing of the same elastic stuff
    of which the wigwam was\nconstructed.\n  There was nothing so very particular,
    perhaps, about the\nappearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny,
    like\nmost old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the\nQuaker
    style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of\nthe minutest
    wrinkles interlacing round eyes, which must have arisen\nfrom his continual sailings
    in many hard gales, and always looking\nto windward;- for this causes the muscles
    about the eyes to become\npursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual
    in a scowl.\n  \"Is this the Captain of the Pequod?\" said I, advancing to the
    door\nof the tent.\n  \"Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost
    thou want of\nhim?\" he demanded.\n  \"I was thinking of shipping.\"\n  \"Thou
    wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer- ever been in a\nstove boat?\"\n 
    \"No, Sir, I never have.\"\n  \"Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare
    say- eh?\n  \"Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I've been\nseveral
    voyages in the merchant service, and I think that-\"\n  \"Merchant service be
    damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see\nthat leg?- I'll take that leg away
    from thy stern, if ever thou\ntalkest of the merchant service to me again. Marchant
    service\nindeed! I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in\nthose
    marchant ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a\nwhaling, eh?-
    it looks a little suspicious, don't it, eh?- Hast not\nbeen a pirate, hast thou?-
    Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst\nthou?- Dost not think of murdering the
    officers when thou gettest to\nsea?\"\n  I protested my innocence of these things.
    I saw that under the\nmask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman,
    as an\ninsulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices,\nand
    rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod\nor the Vineyard.\n 
    \"But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think\nof shipping
    ye.\"\n  \"Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.\"\n 
    \"Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain\nAhab?\"\n 
    \"Who is Captain Ahab, sir?\"\n  \"Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the
    Captain of this ship.\"\n  \"I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to
    the Captain\nhimself.\"\n  \"Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg- that's who ye
    are speaking\nto, young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod\nfitted
    out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs,\nincluding crew. We are
    part owners and agents. But as I was going to\nsay, if thou wantest to know what
    whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I\ncan put ye in a way of finding it out before
    ye bind yourself to it,\npast backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man,
    and thou wilt\nfind that he has only one leg.\"\n  \"What do you mean, sir? Was
    the other one lost by a whale?\"\n  \"Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer
    to me: it was devoured,\nchewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that
    ever chipped a\nboat!- ah, ah!\"\n  I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps
    also a little\ntouched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but
    said as\ncalmly as I could, \"What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but
    how\ncould I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale,\nthough
    indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of\nthe accident.\"\n 
    \"Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d'ye see;\nthou dost
    not talk shark a bit. Sure, ye've been to sea before now;\nsure of that?\"\n 
    \"Sir,\" said I, \"I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in\nthe
    merchant-\"\n  \"Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service-\ndon't
    aggravate me- I won't have it. But let us understand each other.\nI have given
    thee a hint about what whaling is! do ye yet feel\ninclined for it?\"\n  \"I
    do, sir.\"\n  \"Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live\nwhale's
    throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!\"\n  \"I am, sir, if it should
    be positively indispensable to do so; not\nto be got rid of, that is; which I
    don't take to be the fact.\"\n  \"Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest
    to go a-whaling, to\nfind out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want
    to go in\norder to see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so.\nWell
    then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the weather\nbow, and then
    back to me and tell me what ye see there.\"\n  For a moment I stood a little
    puzzled by this curious request, not\nknowing exactly how to take it, whether
    humorously or in earnest.\nBut concentrating all his crow's feet into one scowl,
    Captain Peleg\nstarted me on the errand.\n  Going forward and glancing over the
    weather bow, I perceived that\nthe ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide,
    was now obliquely\npointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited,
    but\nexceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety\nthat I
    could see.\n  \"Well, what's the report?\" said Peleg when I came back; \"what
    did ye\nsee?\"\n  \"Not much,\" I replied- \"nothing but water; considerable
    horizon\nthough, and there's a squall coming up, I think.\"\n  \"Well, what does
    thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish\nto go round Cape Horn to see
    any more of it, eh? Can't ye see the\nworld where you stand?\"\n  I was a little
    staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would;\nand the Pequod was as good
    a ship as any- I thought the best- and\nall this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing
    me so determined, he\nexpressed his willingness to ship me.\n  \"And thou mayest
    as well sign the papers right off,\" he added- \"come\nalong with ye.\" And so
    saying, he led the way below deck into the\ncabin.\n  Seated on the transom was
    what seemed to me a most uncommon and\nsurprising figure. It turned out to be
    Captain Bildad who along with\nCaptain Peleg was one of the largest owners of
    the vessel; the other\nshares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being
    held by a crowd\nof old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery
    wards;\neach owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or
    a\nnail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in\nwhaling
    vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state\nstocks bringing in
    good interest.\n  Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers,
    was a\nQuaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to\nthis
    day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure\npeculiarities of
    the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified\nby things altogether alien
    and heterogeneous. For some of these same\nQuakers are the most sanguinary of
    all sailors and whale-hunters. They\nare fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with
    a vengeance.\n  So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with\nScripture
    names- a singularly common fashion on the island- and in\nchildhood naturally
    imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the\nQuaker idiom; still, from
    the audacious, daring, and boundless\nadventure of their subsequent lives, strangely
    blend with these\nunoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character,
    not\nunworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And\nwhen these
    things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force,\nwith a globular brain
    and a ponderous heart; who has also by the\nstillness and seclusion of many long
    night-watches in the remotest\nwaters, and beneath constellations never seen
    here at the north,\nbeen led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving
    all\nnature's sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin\nvoluntary
    and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some\nhelp from accidental
    advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty\nlanguage- that man makes one in
    a whole nation's census- a mighty\npageant creature, formed for noble tragedies.
    Nor will it at all\ndetract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth
    or other\ncircumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling\nmorbidness
    at the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great\nare made so through
    a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young\nambition, all mortal greatness
    is but disease. But, as yet we have not\nto do with such an one, but with quite
    another; and still a man,\nwho, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from
    another phase of\nthe Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.\n  Like Captain
    Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired\nwhaleman. But unlike Captain
    Peleg- who cared not a rush for what\nare called serious things, and indeed deemed
    those self-same serious\nthings the veriest of all trifles- Captain Bildad had
    not only been\noriginally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket\nQuakerism,
    but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many\nunclad, lovely island
    creatures, round the Horn- all that had not\nmoved this native born Quaker one
    single jot, had not so much as\naltered one angle of his vest. Still, for all
    this immutableness,\nwas there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain\nPeleg.
    Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms\nagainst land invaders,
    yet himself had illimitably invaded the\nAtlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn
    foe to human bloodshed, yet\nhad he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns
    upon tuns of\nleviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days,\nthe
    pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not\nknow; but
    it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he\nhad long since come
    to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man's\nreligion is one thing, and
    this practical world quite another. This\nworld pays dividends. Rising from a
    little cabin boy in short\nclothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a
    broad\nshad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief mate,\nand
    captain, and finally a shipowner; Bildad, as I hinted before,\nhad concluded
    his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active\nlife at the goodly age
    of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days\nto the quiet receiving of his well-earned
    income.\n  Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\nincorrigible
    old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\ntask-master. They told
    me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\ncurious story, that when he sailed
    the old Categut whaleman, his crew,\nupon arriving home, were mostly all carried
    ashore to the hospital,\nsore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially
    for a Quaker,\nhe was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never\nused
    to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an\ninordinate quantity
    of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them.\nWhen Bildad was a chief-mate, to
    have his drab-colored eye intently\nlooking at you, made you feel completely
    nervous, till you could\nclutch something- a hammer or a marrling-spike, and
    go to work like\nmad, at something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness\nperished
    before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his\nutilitarian character.
    On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare\nflesh, no superfluous beard, his
    chin having a soft, economical nap to\nit, like that worn nap of his broad-brimmed
    hat.\n  Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\nfollowed
    Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the\ndecks was small; and
    there, bolt upright, sat old Bildad, who always\nsat so, and never leaned, and
    this to save his coat-tails. His\nbroad-brim was placed beside him; his legs
    were stiffly crossed; his\ndrab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles
    on nose, he\nseemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.\n  \"Bildad,\"
    cried Captain Peleg, \"at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have\nbeen studying those
    Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to\nmy certain knowledge. How far
    ye got, Bildad?\"\n  As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old
    shipmate,\nBildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,\nand
    seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\n  \"He says he's our man,
    Bildad,\" said Peleg, \"he wants to ship.\"\n  \"Dost thee?\" said Bildad, in
    a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\n  \"I dost,\" said I unconsciously,
    he was so intense a Quaker.\n  \"What do ye think of him, Bildad?\" said Peleg.\n 
    \"He'll do,\" said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away\nat his
    book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\n  I thought him the queerest old Quaker
    I ever saw, especially as\nPeleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a
    blusterer. But I\nsaid nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw
    open a\nchest, and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink\nbefore
    him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think\nit was high time
    to settle with myself at what terms I would be\nwilling to engage for the voyage.
    I was already aware that in the\nwhaling business they paid no wages; but all
    hands, including the\ncaptain, received certain shares of the profits called
    lays, and\nthat these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance\npertaining
    to the respective duties of the ship's company. I was\nalso aware that being
    a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be\nvery large; but considering
    that I was used to the sea, could steer\na ship, splice a rope, and all that,
    I made no doubt that from all I\nhad heard I should be offered at least the 275th
    lay- that is, the\n275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever
    that\nmight eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they\ncall
    a rather long lay, yet it was better than nothing; and if we\nhad a lucky voyage,
    might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would\nwear out on it, not to speak
    of my three years' beef and board, for\nwhich I would not have to pay one stiver.\n 
    It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a\nprincely fortune-
    and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am\none of those who never take
    on about princely fortunes, and am quite\ncontent if the world is ready to board
    and lodge me, while I am\nputting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud.
    Upon the whole, I\nthought the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would
    not\nhave been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of\na
    broad-shouldered make.\n  But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little
    distrustful about\nreceiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore,
    I had\nheard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old\ncrony
    Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the\nPequod, therefore
    the other and more inconsiderable and scattered\nowners, left nearly the whole
    management of the ship's affairs to\nthese two. And I did not know but what the
    stingy old Bildad might\nhave a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially
    as I now\nfound him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and\nreading
    his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was\nvainly trying to mend
    a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my\nno small surprise, considering
    that he was such an interested party in\nthese proceedings; Bildad never heeded
    us, but went on mumbling to\nhimself out of his book, \"Lay not up for yourselves
    treasures upon\nearth, where moth-\"\n  \"Well, Captain Bildad,\" interrupted
    Peleg, \"what d'ye say, what\nlay shall we give this young man?\"\n  \"Thou knowest
    best,\" was the sepulchral reply, \"the seven hundred\nand seventy-seventh wouldn't
    be too much, would it?- 'where moth and\nrust do corrupt, but lay-'\"\n  Lay,
    indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\nseventy-seventh! Well,
    old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,\nshall not lay up many lays here
    below, where moth and rust do corrupt.\nIt was an exceedingly long lay that,
    indeed; and though from the\nmagnitude of the figure it might at first deceive
    a landsman, yet\nthe slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred
    and\nseventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a\nteenth
    of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and\nseventy-seventh
    part of a forthing is a good deal less than seven\nhundred and seventy-seven
    gold doubloons; and so I thought at the\ntime.\n  \"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,\"
    cried Peleg, \"thou dost not want\nto swindle this young man! he must have more
    than that.\"\n  \"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,\" again said Bildad, without\nlifting
    his eyes; and then went on mumbling- \"for where your\ntreasure is, there will
    your heart be also.\"\n  \"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,\"
    said Peleg,\n\"do ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.\"\n 
    Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\n\"Captain
    Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the\nduty thou owest
    to the other owners of this ship- widows and\norphans, many of them- and that
    if we too abundantly reward the labors\nof this young man, we may be taking the
    bread from those widows and\nthose orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh
    lay, Captain\nPeleg.\"\n  \"Thou Bildad!\" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering
    about the\ncabin. \"Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in\nthese
    matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that\nwould be heavy
    enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed\nround Cape Horn.\"\n  \"Captain
    Peleg,\" said Bildad steadily, \"thy conscience may be\ndrawing ten inches of
    water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell; but as thou\nart still an impenitent man,
    Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy\nconscience be but a leaky one; and will
    in the end sink thee\nfoundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.\"\n  \"Fiery
    pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural\nbearing, ye insult me. It's
    an all-fired outrage to tell any human\ncreature that he's bound to hell. Flukes
    and flames! Bildad, say\nthat again to me, and start my soulbolts, but I'll-
    I'll- yes, I'll\nswallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the\ncabin,
    ye canting, drab-colored son of a wooden gun- a straight wake\nwith ye!\"\n 
    As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a\nmarvellous oblique,
    sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.\n  Alarmed at this terrible
    outburst between the two principal and\nresponsible owners of the ship, and feeling
    half a mind to give up all\nidea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned
    and temporarily\ncommanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad,\nwho,
    I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the\nawakened wrath
    of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again\non the transom very quietly,
    and seemed to have not the slightest\nintention of withdrawing. He seemed quite
    used to impenitent Peleg and\nhis ways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage
    as he had, there\nseemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb,\nthough
    he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. \"Whew!\" he\nwhistled at
    last- \"the squall's gone off to leeward, I think.\nBildad, thou used to be good
    at sharpening a lance, mend that pen,\nwill ye. My jack-knife here needs the
    grindstone. That's he; thank ye,\nBildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael's thy
    name, didn't ye say?\nWell then, down ye go here, for the three hundredth lay.\"\n 
    \"Captain Peleg,\" said I, \"I have a friend with me who wants to\nship too-
    shall I bring him down to-morrow?\"\n  \"To be sure,\" said Peleg. \"Fetch him
    along, and we'll look at him.\"\n  \"What lay does he want?\" groaned Bildad,
    glancing up from the Book\nin which he had again been burying himself.\n  \"Oh!
    never thee mind about that, Bildad,\" said Peleg. \"Has he ever\nwhaled it any?\"
    turning to me.\n  \"Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.\"\n 
    \"Well, bring him along then.\"\n  And, after signing the papers, off I went;
    nothing doubting but that\nI had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod
    was the\nidentical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round\nthe
    Cape.\n  But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the\nCaptain
    with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,\nindeed, in many cases,
    a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and\nreceive all her crew on board,
    ere the captain makes himself visible\nby arriving to take command; for sometimes
    these voyages are so\nprolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly
    brief,\nthat if the captain have family, or any absorbing concernment of\nthat
    sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port,\nbut leaves her
    to the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is\nalways as well to have
    a look at him before irrevocably committing\nyourself into his hands. Turning
    back I accosted Captain Peleg,\ninquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.\n 
    \"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It's all right enough;\nthou art shipped.\"\n 
    \"Yes, but I should like to see him.\"\n  \"But I don't think thou wilt be able
    to at present. I don't know\nexactly what's the matter with him; but he keeps
    close inside the\nhouse; a sort of sick, and yet he don't look so. In fact, he
    ain't\nsick; but no, he isn't well either. Any how, young man, he won't\nalways
    see me, so I don't suppose he will thee. He's a queer man,\nCaptain Ahab- so
    some think- but a good one. Oh, thou'lt like him well\nenough; no fear, no fear.
    He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain\nAhab; doesn't speak much; but,
    when he does speak, then you may well\nlisten. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab's
    above the common; Ahab's been\nin colleges, as well as 'mong the cannibals; been
    used to deeper\nwonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger\nfoes
    than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and surest that out of\nall our isle!
    Oh! he ain't Captain Bildad; no, and he ain't Captain\nPeleg; he's Ahab, boy;
    and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned\nking!\"\n  \"And a very vile one.
    When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did\nthey not lick his blood?\"\n 
    \"Come hither to me- hither, hither,\" said Peleg, with a significance\nin his
    eye that almost startled me. \"Look ye, lad; never say that on\nboard the Pequod.
    Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name\nhimself .'Twas a foolish, ignorant
    whim of his crazy, widowed\nmother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old.
    And yet the old\nsquaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove\nprophetic.
    And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the\nsame. I wish to warn thee.
    It's a lie. I know Captain Ahab well;\nI've sailed with him as mate years ago;
    know what he is- a good man-\nnot a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing
    good man- something\nlike me- only there's a good deal more of him. Aye, aye,
    I know that\nhe was never very jolly; and I know that on the passage home he
    was\na little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting\npains
    in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one\nmight see. I know,
    too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by\nthat accursed whale, he's
    been a kind of moody- desperate moody, and\nsavage sometimes; but that will all
    pass off. And once for all, let me\ntell thee and assure thee, young man, it's
    better to sail with a moody\ngood captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye
    to thee- and wrong\nnot Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name.
    Besides,\nmy boy, he has a wife- not three voyages wedded- a sweet, resigned\ngirl.
    Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man had a child: hold\nye then there
    can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad;\nstricken, blasted,
    if he be, Ahab has his humanities!\"\n  As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness;
    what had been\nincidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a\ncertain
    wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. And somehow,\nat the time, I felt
    a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't\nknow what, unless it was the
    cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also\nfelt a strange awe of him; but that sort
    of awe, which I cannot at all\ndescribe, was not exactly awe; I do not know what
    it was. But I felt\nit; and it did not disincline me towards him; though I felt
    impatience\nat what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known\nto
    me then. However, my thoughts were at length carried in other\ndirections, so
    that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.\n  "
