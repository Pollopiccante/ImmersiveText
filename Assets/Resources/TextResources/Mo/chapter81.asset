  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 82,   The Honor and Glory of Whaling
  content: "\n  Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,\naccording
    to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;\nneither craven
    nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an\nindifferent air; and while engaged
    in the most imminent crisis of\nthe chase, toiling away, calm and collected as
    a journeyman joiner\nengaged for the year. Good-humored, easy, and careless,
    he presided\nover his whaleboat as if the most deadly encounter were but a\ndinner,
    and his crew all invited guests. He was as particular about\nthe comfortable
    arrangements of his part of the boat, as an old\nstage-driver is about the snugness
    of his box. When close to the\nwhale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he
    handled his unpitying\nlance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his
    hammer. He\nwould hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the\nmost
    exasperated monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted\nthe jaws of death
    into an easy chair. What he thought of death itself,\nthere is no telling. Whether
    he ever thought of it at all, might be\na question; but, if he ever did chance
    to cast his mind that way after\na comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good
    sailor, he took it to be a\nsort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir
    themselves\nthere, about something which he would find out when he obeyed the\norder,
    and not sooner.\n  What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,\nunfearing
    man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a\nworld fail of grave
    peddlers, all bowed to the ground with their\npacks; what helped to bring about
    that almost impious good-humor of\nhis; that thing must have been his pipe. For,
    like his nose, his\nshort, black little pipe was one of the regular features
    of his\nface. You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his\nbunk
    without his nose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of\npipes there ready
    loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his\nhand; and, whenever he turned
    in, he smoked them all out in\nsuccession, lighting one from the other to the
    end of the chapter;\nthen loading them again to be in readiness anew. For, when
    Stubb\ndressed, instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers, he put\nhis
    pipe into his mouth.\n  I say this continual smoking must have been one cause,
    at least of\nhis peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this early air,\nwhether
    ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless\nmiseries of the numberless
    mortals who have died exhaling it; and as\nin time of the cholera, some people
    go about with a camphorated\nhandkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against
    all mortal\ntribulations, Stubb's tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort
    of\ndisinfecting agent.\n  The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in
    Martha's Vineyard.\nA short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning
    whales,\nwho somehow seemed to think that the great Leviathans had personally\nand
    hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point\nof honor with
    him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly\nlost was he to all sense
    of reverence for the many marvels of their\nmajestic bulk and mystic ways; and
    so dead to anything like an\napprehension of any possible danger encountering
    them; that in his\npoor opinion, the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified
    mouse,\nor at least water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and\nsome
    small application of time and trouble in order to kill and\nboil. This ignorant,
    unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little\nwaggish in the matter of whales;
    he followed these fish for the fun of\nit; and a three years' voyage round Cape
    Horn was only a jolly joke\nthat lasted that length of time. As a carpenter's
    nails are divided\ninto wrought nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly
    divided.\nLittle Flask was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and\nlast
    long. They called him King-Post on board of the Pequod;\nbecause, in form, he
    could be well likened to the short, square timber\nknown by that name in Arctic
    whalers; and which by the means of many\nradiating side timbers inserted into
    it, serves to brace the ship\nagainst the icy concussions of those battering
    seas.\n  Now these three mates- Starbuck, Stubb and Flask, were momentous\nmen.
    They was who by universal prescription commanded three of the\nPequod's boats
    as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which\nCaptain Ahab would probably
    marshal his forces to descend on the\nwhales, these three headsmen were as captains
    of companies. Or,\nbeing armed with their long keen whaling spears, they were
    as a picked\ntrio of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.\n 
    And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a\nGothic Knight
    of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or\nharpooneer, who in certain
    conjunctures provides him with a fresh\nlance, when the former one has been badly
    twisted, or elbowed in the\nassault; and moreover, as there generally subsists
    between the two,\na close intimacy and friendliness; it is therefore but meet,
    that in\nthis place we set down who the Pequod's harpooneers were, and to\nwhat
    headsman each of them belonged.\n  First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck,
    the chief mate, had\nselected for his squire. But Queequeg is already known.\n 
    Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most\nwesterly promontory
    of Martha's Vineyard, where there still exists the\nlast remnant of a village
    of red men, which has long supplied the\nneighboring island of Nantucket with
    many of her most daring\nharpooneers. In the fishery, they usually go by the
    generic name of\nGay-Headers. Tashtego's long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek\nbones,
    and black rounding eyes- for an Indian, Oriental in their\nlargeness, but Antarctic
    in their glittering expression- all this\nsufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor
    of the unvitiated blood of\nthose proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the
    great New England\nmoose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of
    the main.\nBut no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the\nwoodland,
    Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the\nsea; the unerring
    harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible\narrow of the sires. To look
    at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky\nlimbs, you would almost have credited
    the superstitions of some of the\nearlier Puritans and half-believed this wild
    Indian to be a son of the\nPrince of the Powers of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb
    the second\nmate's squire.\n  Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic,
    coal-black\nnegro-savage, with a lion-like tread- an Ahasuerus to behold.\nSuspended
    from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the\nsailors called them ringbolts,
    and would talk of securing the top-sail\nhalyards to them. In his youth Daggoo
    had voluntarily shipped on board\nof a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native
    coast. And never\nhaving been anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket,
    and the\npagan harbors most frequented by the whalemen; and having now led\nfor
    many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners\nuncommonly heedful
    of what manner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained\nall his barbaric virtues,
    and erect as a giraffe, moved about the\ndecks in all the pomp of six feet five
    in his socks. There was a\ncorporeal humility in looking up at him; and a white
    man standing\nbefore him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress.\nCurious
    to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the Squire\nof little Flask,
    who looked like a chess-man beside him. As for the\nresidue of the Pequod's company,
    be it said, that at the present day\nnot one in two of the many thousand men
    before the mast employed in\nthe American whale fishery, are Americans born,
    though pretty nearly\nall the officers are. Herein it is the same with the American
    whale\nfishery as with the American army and military and merchant navies,\nand
    the engineering forces employed in the construction of the\nAmerican Canals and
    Railroads. The same, I say, because in all these\ncases the native American literally
    provides the brains, the rest of\nthe world as generously supplying the muscles.
    No small number of\nthese whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the outward
    bound\nNantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the\nhardy
    peasants of those rocky shores. In like manner, the Greenland\nwhalers sailing
    out of Hull or London, put in at the Shetland Islands,\nto receive the full complement
    of their crew. Upon the passage\nhomewards, they drop them there again. How it
    is, there is no telling,\nbut Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They
    were nearly all\nIslanders in the Pequod, Isolatoes too, I call such, not acknowledging\nthe
    common continent of men, but each Isolato living on a separate\ncontinent of
    his own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set\nthese Isolatoes were!
    An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the\nisles of the sea, and all the ends
    of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab\nin the Pequod to lay the world's grievances
    before that bar from which\nnot very many of them ever come back. Black Little
    Pip- he never\ndid- oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod's\nforecastle,
    ye shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine;\nprelusive of the eternal
    time, when sent for, to the great\nquarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in
    with angels, and beat his\ntambourine in glory; called a coward here, hailed
    a hero there!\n  "
