  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 79,   The Prairie
  content: "\n  The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket,\nand
    a Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born\non an icy coast,
    seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his\nflesh being hard as twice-baked
    biscuit. Transported to the Indies,\nhis live blood would not spoil like bottled
    ale. He must have been\nborn in some time of general drought and famine, or upon
    one of\nthose fast days for which his state is famous. Only some thirty and\nsummers
    had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical\nsuperfluousness. But
    this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more\nthe token of wasting anxieties
    and cares, than it seemed the\nindication of any bodily blight. It was merely
    the condensation of the\nman. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary.
    His pure\ntight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it, and\nembalmed
    with inner health and strength, like a revivified Egyptian,\nthis Starbuck seemed
    prepared to endure for long ages to come, and\nto endure always, as now; for
    be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a\npatent chronometer, his interior vitality
    was warranted to do well\nin all climates. Looking into his eves, you seemed
    to see there the\nyet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly\nconfronted
    through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life for the\nmost part was a telling
    pantomime of action, and not a tame chapter of\nsounds. Yet, for all his hardy
    sobriety and fortitude, there were\ncertain qualities in him which at times affected,
    and in some cases\nseemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly conscientious\nfor
    a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild\nwatery loneliness
    of his life did therefore strongly incline him to\nsuperstition; but to that
    sort of superstition, which in some\norganization seems rather to spring, somehow,
    from intelligence than\nfrom ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments
    were his.\nAnd if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much\nmore
    did his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and\nchild, tend to
    bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his\nnature, and open him
    still further to those latent influences which,\nin some honest-hearted men,
    restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so\noften evinced by others in the more
    perilous vicissitudes of the\nfishery. \"I will have no man in my boat,\" said
    Starbuck, \"who is not\nafraid of a whale.\" By this, he seemed to mean, not
    only that the most\nreliable and useful courage was that which arises from the
    fair\nestimation of the encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless\nman
    is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.\n  \"Aye, aye,\" said Stubb, the
    second mate, \"Starbuck, there, is as\ncareful a man as you'll find anywhere
    in this fishery.\" But we shall\nere long see what that word \"careful\" precisely
    means when used by a\nman like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.\n  Starbuck
    was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a\nsentiment; but a thing
    simply useful to him, and always at hand upon\nall mortally practical occasions.
    Besides, he thought, perhaps, that\nin this business of whaling, courage was
    one of the great staple\noutfits of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and
    not to be\nfoolishly wasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales\nafter
    sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much\npersisted in fighting
    him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this\ncritical ocean to kill whales
    for my living, and not to be killed by\nthem for theirs; and that hundreds of
    men had been so killed\nStarbuck well knew. What doom was his own father's? Where,
    in the\nbottomless deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?\n  With
    memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain\nsuperstitiousness,
    as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck,\nwhich could, nevertheless, still
    flourish, must indeed have been\nextreme. But it was not in reasonable nature
    that a man so\norganized, and with such terrible experiences and remembrances
    as he\nhad; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently\nengendering
    an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances,\nwould break out from
    its confinement, and burn all his courage up. And\nbrave as he might be, it was
    that sort of bravery chiefly, visible\nin some intrepid men, which, while generally
    abiding firm in the\nconflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the ordinary\nirrational
    horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more\nterrific, because more
    spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you\nfrom the concentrating brow of
    an enraged and mighty man.\n  But were the coming narrative to reveal in any
    instance, the\ncomplete abasement of poor Starbuck's fortitude, scarce might
    I have\nthe heart to write it; but it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking,\nto
    expose the fall of valor in the soul. Men may seem detestable as\njoint stock-companies
    and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers\nthere may be; men may have mean and
    meagre faces; but, man, in the\nideal, is so noble and so sparkling, such a grand
    and glowing\ncreature, that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows\nshould
    run to throw their costliest robes. That immaculate manliness\nwe feel within
    ourselves, so far within us, that it remains intact\nthough all the outer character
    seem gone; bleeds with keenest\nanguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined
    man. Nor can piety\nitself, at such a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraidings\nagainst
    the permitting stars. But this august dignity I treat of, is\nnot the dignity
    of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which\nhas no robed investiture.
    Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that\nwields a pick or drives a spike; that
    democratic dignity which, on all\nhands, radiates without end from God; Himself!
    The great God absolute!\nThe centre and circumference of all democracy! His omnipresence,
    our\ndivine equality!\n  If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways,
    I\nshall hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave around them\ntragic
    graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased,\namong them all,
    shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts;\nif I shall touch that workman's
    arm with some ethereal light; if I\nshall spread a rainbow over his disastrous
    set of sun; then against\nall mortal critics bear me out in it, thou just Spirit
    of Equality,\nwhich hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind!\nBear
    me out in it, thou great democratic God! who didst not refuse\nto the swart convict,
    Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst\nclothe with doubly hammered leaves
    of finest gold, the stumped and\npaupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who didst
    pick up Andrew Jackson\nfrom the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a war-horse;
    who didst\nthunder him higher than a throne! Thou who, in all Thy mighty, earthly\nmarchings,
    ever cullest Thy selectest champions from the kingly\ncommoners; bear me out
    in it, O God!\n  "
