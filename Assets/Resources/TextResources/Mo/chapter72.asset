  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 73,   Stubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a
    Talk Over Him
  content: "\n  As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of\nwhaling;
    and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be\nregarded among landsmen
    as a rather unpoetical and disreputable\npursuit; therefore, I am all anxiety
    to convince ye, ye landsmen, of\nthe injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales.\n 
    In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish\nthe fact,
    that among people at large, the business of whaling is not\naccounted on a level
    with what are called the liberal professions.\nIf a stranger were introduced
    into any miscellaneous metropolitan\nsociety, it would but slightly advance the
    general opinion of his\nmerits, were he presented to the company as a harpooneer,
    say; and\nif in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials\nS.W.F.
    (Sperm Whale Fishery) to his visting card, such a procedure\nwould be deemed
    preeminently presuming and ridiculous.\n  Doubtless one leading reason why the
    world declines honoring us\nwhalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our
    vocation amounts to a\nbutchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged
    therein,\nwe are surrounded by all manner of defilements. Butchers we are,\nthat
    is true. But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest\nbadge have been all
    Martial Commanders whom the world invariably\ndelights to honor. And as for the
    matter of the alleged\nuncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon be initiated
    into certain\nfacts hitherto pretty generally unknown, and which, upon the whole,\nwill
    triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at least among the\ncleanliest things
    of this tidy earth. But even granting the charge\nin question to be true; what
    disordered slippery decks of a whale-ship\nare comparable to the unspeakable
    carrion of those battle-fields\nfrom which so many soldiers return to drink in
    all ladies' plaudits?\nAnd if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular
    conceit of the\nsoldier's profession; let me assure ye that many a veteran who
    has\nfreely marched up to a battery, would quickly recoil at the apparition\nof
    the sperm whale's vast tail, fanning into eddies the air over his\nhead. For
    what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the\ninterlinked terrors
    and wonders of God!\n  But, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet
    does it\nunwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding\nadoration!
    for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn\nround the globe, burn,
    as before so many shrines, to our glory!\n  But look at this matter in other
    lights; weigh it in all sorts of\nscales; see what we whalemen are, and have
    been.\n  Why did the Dutch in De Witt's time have admirals of their whaling\nfleets?
    Why did Louis XVI of France, at his own personal expense,\nfit out whaling ships
    from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town\nsome score or two of families
    from our own island of Nantucket? Why\ndid Britain between the years 1750 and
    1788 pay to her whalemen in\nbounties upwards of L1,000,000? And lastly, how
    comes it that we\nwhalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded\nwhalemen
    in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred\nvessels; manned by eighteen
    thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000\nof dollars; the ships worth, at the
    time of sailing, $20,000,000!\nand every year importing into our harbors a well
    reaped harvest of\n$7,000,000. How comes all this, if there be not something
    puissant\nin whaling?\n  But this is not the half; look again.\n  I freely assert,
    that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his\nlife, point out one single
    peaceful influence, which within the last\nsixty years has operated more potentially
    upon the whole broad\nworld, taken in one aggregate, than the high and mighty
    business of\nwhaling. One way and another, it has begotten events so remarkable\nin
    themselves, and so continuously momentous in their sequential\nissues, that whaling
    may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who\nbore offspring themselves
    pregnant from her womb. It would be a\nhopeless, endless task to catalogue all
    these things. Let a handful\nsuffice. For many years past the whale-ship has
    been the pioneer in\nferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the
    earth. She has\nexplored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart, where no
    Cooke\nor Vancouver had ever sailed. If American and European men-of-war\nnow
    peacefully ride in once savage harbors, let them fire salutes to\nthe honor and
    glory of the whale-ship, which originally showed them\nthe way, and first interpreted
    between them and the savages. They\nmay celebrate as they will the heroes of
    Exploring Expeditions, your\nCookes, your Krusensterns; but I say that scores
    of anonymous Captains\nhave sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and
    greater, than\nyour Cooke and your Krusenstern. For in their succorless\nempty-handedness,
    they, in the heathenish sharked waters, and by the\nbeaches of unrecorded, javelin
    islands, battled with virgin wonders\nand terrors that Cooke with all his marines
    and muskets would not have\nwillingly dared. All that is made such a flourish
    of in the old\nSouth Sea Voyages, those things were but the life-time commonplaces
    of\nour heroic Nantucketers. Often, adventures which Vancouver dedicates\nthree
    chapters to, these men accounted unworthy of being set down in\nthe ship's common
    log. Ah, the world! Oh, the world!\n  Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn,
    no commerce but colonial,\nscarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried
    on between Europe\nand the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the
    Pacific\ncoast. It was the whalemen who first broke through the jealous\npolicy
    of the Spanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space\npermitted, it might
    be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at\nlast eventuated the liberation
    of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the\nyoke of Old Spain, and the establishment
    of the eternal democracy in\nthose parts.\n  That great America on the other
    side of the sphere, Australia, was\ngiven to the enlightened world by whaleman.
    After its first\nblunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships, long
    shunned\nthose shores as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched\nthere.
    The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony.\nMoreover, in the
    infancy of the first Australian settlement, the\nemigrants were several times
    saved from starvation by the benevolent\nbiscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping
    an anchor in their\nwaters. The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the
    same truth,\nand do commercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way
    for\nthe missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the\nprimitive
    missionaries to their first destinations. If that\ndouble-bolted land, Japan,
    is ever to become hospitable, it is the\nwhale-ship alone to whom the credit
    will be due; for already she is on\nthe threshold.\n  But if, in the face of
    all this, you still declare that whaling\nhas no aesthetically noble associations
    connected with it, then am I\nready to shiver fifty lances with you there, and
    unhorse you with a\nsplit helmet every time.\n  The whale has no famous author,
    and whaling no famous chronicler,\nyou will say.\n  The whale no famous author,
    and whaling no famous chronicler? Who\nwrote the first account of our Leviathan?
    Who but mighty Job? And\nwho composed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage?
    Who, but no less\na prince than Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen,
    took down\nthe words from Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times! And\nwho
    pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament? Who, but Edmund\nBurke!\n  True
    enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have\nno good blood
    in their veins.\n  No good blood in their veins? They have something better than\nroyal
    blood there. The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary\nMorrel; afterwards,
    by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old\nsettlers of Nantucket, and the ancestress
    to a long line of Folgers\nand harpooneers- all kith and kin to noble Benjamin-
    this day\ndarting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.\n 
    Good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not\nrespectable.\n 
    Whaling not respectable? Whaling is imperial! By old English\nstatutory law,
    the whale is declared \"a royal fish.\"\n  Oh, that's only nominal! The whale
    himself has never figured in\nany grand imposing way.\n  The whale never figured
    in any grand imposing way? In one of the\nmighty triumphs given to a Roman general
    upon his entering the world's\ncapital, the bones of a whale, brought all the
    way from the Syrian\ncoast, were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed
    procession.*\n\n  *See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.\n\n 
    Grant it, since you cite it; but say what you will, there is no real\ndignity
    in whaling.\n  No dignity in whaling? The dignity of our calling the very heavens\nattest.
    Cetus is a constellation in the south! No more! Drive down\nyour hat in presence
    of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg! No\nmore! I know a man that, in his
    lifetime has taken three hundred and\nfifty whales. I account that man more honorable
    than that great\ncaptain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns.\n 
    And, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet\nundiscovered prime
    thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real\nrepute in that small but high
    hushed world which I might not be\nunreasonably ambitious of; if hereafter I
    shall do anything upon the\nwhole, a man might rather have done than to have
    left undone; if, at\nmy death, my executors, or more properly my creditors, find
    any\nprecious MSS. in my desk, then here I prospectively ascribe all the\nhonor
    and the glory to whaling; for a whale-ship was my Yale College\nand my Harvard.\n  "
