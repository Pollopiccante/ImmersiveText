  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 31,   Queen Mab
  content: "\n  Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there\nquite
    alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some\ntime. He was sitting
    on a bench before the fire, with his feet on\nthe stove hearth, and in one hand
    was holding close up to his face\nthat little negro idol of his; peering hard
    into its face, and with\na jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile
    humming to\nhimself in his heathenish way.\n  But being now interrupted, he put
    up the image; and pretty soon,\ngoing to the table, took up a large book there,
    and placing it on\nhis lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity;
    at\nevery fiftieth page- as I fancied- stopping for a moment, looking\nvacantly
    around him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling\nwhistle of astonishment.
    He would then begin again at the next\nfifty; seeming to commence at number one
    each time, as though he could\nnot count more than fifty, and it was only by
    such a large number of\nfifties being found together, that his astonishment at
    the multitude\nof pages was excited.\n  With much interest I sat watching him.
    Savage though he was, and\nhideously marred about the face- at least to my taste-
    his countenance\nyet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable.
    You\ncannot hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I\nthought I
    saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large,\ndeep eyes, fiery
    black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit\nthat would dare a thousand devils.
    And besides all this, there was a\ncertain lofty bearing about the Pagan, which
    even his uncouthness\ncould not altogether maim. He looked like a man who had
    never\ncringed and never had had a creditor. Whether it was, too, that his\nhead
    being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter\nrelief, and looked
    more expansive than it otherwise would, this I will\nnot venture to decide; but
    certain it was his head was phrenologically\nan excellent one. It may seem ridiculous,
    but it reminded me of\nGeneral Washington's head, as seen in the popular busts
    of him. It had\nthe same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the\nbrows,
    which were likewise very projecting, like two long promontories\nthickly wooded
    on top. Queequeg was George Washington\ncannibalistically developed.\n  Whilst
    I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to\nbe looking out
    at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my\npresence, never troubled
    himself with so much as a single glance;\nbut appeared wholly occupied with counting
    the pages of the marvellous\nbook. Considering how sociably we had been sleeping
    together the night\nprevious, and especially considering the affectionate arm
    I had\nfound thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this\nindifference
    of his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at\ntimes you do not know
    exactly how to take them. At first they are\noverawing; their calm self-collectedness
    of simplicity seems as\nSocratic wisdom. I had noticed also that Queequeg never
    consorted at\nall, or but very little, with the other seamen in the inn. He made\nno
    advances whatever; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle\nof his acquaintances.
    All this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon\nsecond thoughts, there was
    something almost sublime in it. Here was\na man some twenty thousand miles from
    home, by the way of Cape Horn,\nthat is- which was the only way he could get
    there- thrown among\npeople as strange to him as though he were in the planet
    Jupiter;\nand yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost\nserenity;
    content with his own companionship; always equal to himself.\nSurely this was
    a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had\nnever heard there was such
    a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be true\nphilosophers, we mortals should not
    be conscious of so living or so\nstriving. So soon as I hear that such or such
    a man gives himself\nout for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic
    old\nwoman, he must have \"broken his digester.\"\n  As I sat there in that now
    lonely room; the fire burning low, in\nthat mild stage when, after its first
    intensity has warmed the air, it\nthen only glows to be looked at; the evening
    shades and phantoms\ngathering round the casements, and peering in upon us silent,
    solitary\ntwain; the storm booming without in solemn swells; I began to be\nsensible
    of strange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my\nsplintered heart and
    maddened hand were turned against the wolfish\nworld. This soothing savage had
    redeemed it. There he sat, his very\nindifference speaking a nature in which
    there lurked no civilized\nhypocrisies and bland deceits. he was; a very sight
    of sights to\nsee; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him.
    And\nthose same things that would have repelled most others, they were\nthe very
    magnets that thus drew me. I'll try a pagan friend, thought\nI, since Christian
    kindness has proved but hollow courtesy. I drew\nmy bench near him, and made
    some friendly signs and hints, doing my\nbest to talk with him meanwhile. At
    first he little noticed these\nadvances; but presently, upon my referring to
    his last night's\nhospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again
    to be\nbedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased,\nperhaps
    a little complimented.\n  We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored
    to explain\nto him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few\npictures
    that were in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from\nthat we went to
    jabbering the best we could about the various outer\nsights to be seen in this
    famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke;\nand, producing his pouch and tomahawk,
    he quietly offered me a puff.\nAnd then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild
    pipe of his, and\nkeeping it regularly passing between us.\n  If there yet lurked
    any ice of indifference towards me in the\nPagan's breast, this pleasant, genial
    smoke we had, soon thawed it\nout, and left us cronies. He seemed to take to
    me quite as naturally\nand unbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over,
    he pressed\nhis forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that\nhenceforth
    we were married; meaning, in his country's phrase, that\nwe were bosom friends;
    he would gladly die for me, if need should\nbe. In a countryman, this sudden
    flame of friendship would have seemed\nfar too premature, a thing to be much
    distrusted; but in this simple\nsavage those old rules would not apply.\n  After
    supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room\ntogether. He
    made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his\nenormous tobacco wallet,
    and groping under the tobacco, drew out\nsome thirty dollars in silver; then
    spreading them on the table, and\nmechanically dividing them into two equal portions,
    pushed one of them\ntowards me, and said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate;
    but he\nsilenced me by pouring them into my trowsers' pockets. I let them\nstay.
    He then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and\nremoved the paper
    firebrand. By certain signs and symptoms, I\nthought he seemed anxious for me
    to join him; but well knowing what\nwas to follow, I deliberated a moment whether,
    in case he invited\nme, I would comply or otherwise.\n  I was a good Christian;
    born and bred in the bosom of the infallible\nPresbyterian Church. How then could
    I unite with this wild idolator in\nworshipping his piece of wood? But what is
    worship? thought I. Do\nyou suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of
    heaven and\nearth- pagans and all included- can possibly be jealous of an\ninsignificant
    bit of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?-\nto do the will of God?
    that is worship. And what is the will of\nGod?- to do to my fellow man what I
    would have my fellow man to do\nto me- that is the will of God. Now, Queequeg
    is my fellow man. And\nwhat do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me? Why,
    unite with me\nin my particular Presbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I
    must\nthen unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled\nthe
    shavings; helped prop up the innocent little idol; offered him\nburnt biscuit
    with Queequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice;\nkissed his nose; and that
    done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace\nwith our own consciences and all
    the world. But we did not go to sleep\nwithout some little chat.\n  How it is
    I know not; but there is no place like a bed for\nconfidential disclosures between
    friends. Man and wife, they say,\nthere open the very bottom of their souls to
    each other; and some\nold couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly
    morning.\nThus, then, in our hearts' honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg- a cosy,\nloving
    pair.\n  "
