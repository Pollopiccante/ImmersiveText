  content: "\n  It was nearly six o'clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn,\nwhen
    we drew nigh the wharf.\n  \"There are some sailors running ahead there, if I
    see right,\" said I\nto Queequeg, \"it can't be shadow; she's off by sunrise,
    I guess;\ncome on!\"\n  \"Avast!\" cried a voice, whose owner at the same time
    coming close\nbehind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating\nhimself
    between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the\nuncertain twilight, strangely
    peering from Queequeg to me. It was\nElijah.\n  \"Going aboard?\"\n  \"Hands
    off, will you,\" said I.\n  \"Lookee here,\" said Queequeg, shaking himself,
    \"go 'way!\"\n  \"Aint going aboard, then?\"\n  \"Yes, we are,\" said I, \"but
    what business is that of yours? Do you\nknow, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you
    a little impertinent?\"\n  \"No, no, no; I wasn't aware of that,\" said Elijah,
    slowly and\nwonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable\nglances.\n 
    \"Elijah,\" said I, \"you will oblige my friend and me by\nwithdrawing. We are
    going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and\nwould prefer not to be detained.\"\n 
    \"Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?\"\n  \"He's cracked, Queequeg,\"
    said I, \"come on.\"\n  \"Holloa!\" cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when
    we had removed\na few paces.\n  \"Never mind him,\" said I, \"Queequeg, come
    on.\"\n  But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my\nshoulder,
    said- \"Did ye see anything looking like men going towards\nthat ship a while
    ago?\"\n  Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying,\n\"Yes,
    I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be\nsure.\"\n  \"Very
    dim, very dim,\" said Elijah. \"Morning to ye.\"\n  Once more we quitted him;
    but once more he came softly after us; and\ntouching my shoulder again, said,
    \"See if you can find 'em now, will\nye?\n  \"Find who?\"\n  \"Morning to ye!
    morning to ye!\" he rejoined, again moving off.\n\"Oh! I was going to warn ye
    against- but never mind, never mind-\nit's all one, all in the family too;- sharp
    frost this morning,\nain't it? Good-bye to ye. Shan't see ye again very soon,
    I guess;\nunless it's before the Grand Jury.\" And with these cracked words he\nfinally
    departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small wonderment\nat his frantic
    impudence.\n  At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in\nprofound
    quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked\nwithin; the hatches
    were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging.\nGoing forward to the forecastle,
    we found the slide of the scuttle\nopen. Seeing a light, we went down, and found
    only an old rigger\nthere, wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at
    whole length\nupon two chests, his face downwards and inclosed in his folded
    arms.\nThe profoundest slumber slept upon him.\n  \"Those sailors we saw, Queequeg,
    where can they have gone to?\"\nsaid I, looking dubiously at the sleeper. But
    it seemed that, when\non the wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now
    alluded to;\nhence I would have thought myself to have been optically deceived
    in\nthat matter, were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question.\nBut
    I beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly\nhinted to Queequeg
    that perhaps we had best sit up with the body;\ntelling him to establish himself
    accordingly. He put his hand upon the\nsleeper's rear, as though feeling if it
    was soft enough; and then,\nwithout more ado, sat quietly down there.\n  \"Gracious!
    Queequeg, don't sit there,\" said I.\n  \"Oh; perry dood seat,\" said Queequeg,
    \"my country way; won't hurt\nhim face.\"\n  \"Face!\" said I, \"call that his
    face? very benevolent countenance\nthen; but how hard he breathes, he's heaving
    himself; get off,\nQueequeg, you are heavy, it's grinding the face of the poor.
    Get\noff, Queequeg! Look, he'll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don't\nwake.\"\n 
    Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and\nlighted
    his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing\nover the sleeper,
    from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning\nhim in his broken fashion,
    Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his\nland, owing to the absence of settees
    and sofas of all sorts, the\nking, chiefs, and great people generally, were in
    the custom of\nfattening some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish
    a\nhouse comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten\nlazy
    fellows, and lay them around in the piers and alcoves. Besides,\nit was very
    convenient on an excursion; much better than those\ngarden-chairs which are convertible
    into walking sticks; upon\noccasion, a chief calling his attendant, and desiring
    him to make a\nsettee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp\nmarshy
    place.\n  While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the\ntomahawk
    from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the\nsleeper's head.\n  \"What's
    that for, Queequeg?\"\n  \"Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!\n  He was going
    on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe\nwhich, it seemed, had
    in its two uses both brained his foes and\nsoothed his soul, when we were directly
    attracted to the sleeping\nrigger. The strong vapor now completely filling the
    contracted hole,\nit began to tell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness;\nthen
    seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice;\nthen sat up and
    rubbed his eyes.\n  \"Holloa!\" he breathed at last, \"who be ye smokers?\"\n 
    \"Shipped men,\" answered I, \"when does she sail?\"\n  \"Aye, aye, ye are going
    in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain\ncame aboard last night.\"\n  \"What
    Captain?- Ahab?\"\n  \"Who but him indeed?\"\n  I was going to ask him some further
    questions concerning Ahab,\nwhen we heard a noise on deck.\n  \"Holloa! Starbuck's
    astir,\" said the rigger. \"He's a lively chief\nmate that; good man, and a pious;
    but all alive now, I must turn\nto.\" And so saying he went on deck, and we followed.\n 
    It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and\nthrees; the
    riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively\nengaged; and several of
    the shore people were busy in bringing various\nlast things on board. Meanwhile
    Captain Ahab remained invisibly\nenshrined within his cabin.\n  "
