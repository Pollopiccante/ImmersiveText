  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 109,   Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin
  content: "\n  (Enter Ahab: Then, all)\n\n  It was not a great while after the affair
    of the pipe, that one\nmorning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont,
    ascended the\ncabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk
    at\nthat hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns\nin
    the garden.\n  Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced\nhis
    old rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were\nall over dented,
    like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his\nwalk. Did you fixedly
    gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow;\nthere also, you would see still
    stranger foot-prints- the\nfoot-prints of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.\n 
    But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even\nas his nervous
    step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of\nhis thought was Ahab,
    that at every uniform turn that he made, now\nat the main-mast and now at the
    binnacle, you could almost see that\nthought turn in him as he turned, and pace
    in him as he paced; so\ncompletely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed
    the inward\nmould of every outer movement.\n  \"D'ye mark him, Flask?\" whispered
    Stubb; \"the chick that's in him\npecks the shell. 'Twill soon be out.\"\n  The
    hours wore on;- Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon,\npacing the deck, with
    the same intense bigotry of purpose in his\naspect.\n  It drew near the close
    of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the\nbulwarks, and inserting his bone leg
    into the auger-hole there, and\nwith one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck
    to send everybody\naft.\n  \"Sir!\" said the mate, astonished at an order seldom
    or never given\non ship-board except in some extraordinary case.\n  \"Send everybody
    aft,\" repeated Ahab. \"Mast-heads, there! come down!\"\n  When the entire ship's
    company were assembled, and with curious\nand not wholly unapprehensive faces,
    were eyeing him, for he looked\nnot unlike the weather horizon when a storm is
    coming up, Ahab,\nafter rapidly glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting
    his eyes\namong the crew, started from his standpoint; and as though not a\nsoul
    were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck. With bent\nhead and half-slouched
    hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the\nwondering whispering among the men;
    till Stubb cautiously whispered to\nFlask, that Ahab must have summoned them
    there for the purpose of\nwitnessing a pedestrian feat. But this did not last
    long. Vehemently\npausing, he cried:-\n  \"What do ye do when ye see a whale,
    men?\"\n  \"Sing out for him!\" was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of\nclubbed
    voices.\n  \"Good!\" cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing
    the\nhearty animation into which his unexpected question had so\nmagnetically
    thrown them.\n  \"And what do ye next, men?\"\n  \"Lower away, and after him!\"\n 
    \"And what tune is it ye pull to, men?\"\n  \"A dead whale or a stove boat!\"\n 
    More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the\ncountenance
    of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to\ngaze curiously at
    each other, as if marvelling how it was that they\nthemselves became so excited
    at such seemingly purposeless questions.\n  But, they were all eagerness again,
    as Ahab, now half-revolving in\nhis pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up
    a shroud, and\ntightly, almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:-\n 
    \"All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a\nwhite whale.
    Look ye! d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?\"- holding\nup a broad bright coin
    to the sun- \"it is a sixteen dollar piece, men.\nD'ye see it? Mr. Starbuck,
    hand me yon top-maul.\"\n  While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without
    speaking, was\nslowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket,
    as\nif to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile\nlowly
    humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and\ninarticulate
    that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of\nhis vitality in him.\n 
    Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the\nmain-mast with
    the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold\nwith the other, and with
    a high raised voice exclaiming: \"Whosoever of\nye raises me a white-headed whale
    with a wrinkled brow and a crooked\njaw; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed
    whale, with three\nholes punctured in his starboard fluke- look ye, whosoever
    of ye\nraises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my\nboys!\"\n 
    \"Huzza! huzza!\" cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they\nhailed
    the act of nailing the gold to the mast.\n  \"It's a white whale, I say,\" resumed
    Ahab, as he threw down the\ntopmaul: \"a white whale. Skin your eyes for him,
    men; look sharp for\nwhite water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.\"\n  All
    this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with\neven more intense
    interest and surprise than the rest, and at the\nmention of the wrinkled brow
    and crooked jaw they had started as if\neach was separately touched by some specific
    recollection.\n  \"Captain Ahab,\" said Tashtego, \"that white whale must be
    the same\nthat some call Moby Dick.\"\n  \"Moby Dick?\" shouted Ahab. \"Do ye
    know the white whale then, Tash?\"\n  \"Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir,
    before he goes down?\"\nsaid the Gay-Header deliberately.\n  \"And has he a curious
    spout, too,\" said Daggoo, \"very bushy, even\nfor a parmacetty, and mighty quick,
    Captain Ahab?\"\n  \"And he have one, two, three- oh! good many iron in him hide,
    too,\nCaptain,\" cried Queequeg disjointedly, \"all twiske-tee be-twisk,\nlike
    him- him-\" faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round\nand round
    as though uncorking a bottle- \"like him- him-\"\n  \"Corkscrew!\" cried Ahab,
    \"aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all\ntwisted and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo,
    his spout is a big one, like\na whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of
    our Nantucket wool\nafter the great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and
    he fan-tails\nlike a split jib in a squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby
    Dick\nye have seen- Moby Dick- Moby Dick!\"\n  \"Captain Ahab,\" said Starbuck,
    who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus\nfar been eyeing his superior with increasing
    surprise, but at last\nseemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained
    all the\nwonder. \"Captain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick- but it was not\nMoby
    Dick that took off thy leg?\"\n  \"Who told thee that?\" cried Ahab; then pausing,
    \"Aye, Starbuck; aye,\nmy hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted
    me; Moby Dick\nthat brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,\"
    he\nshouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a\nheart-stricken
    moose; \"Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that\nrazeed me; made a poor
    pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!\"\nThen tossing both arms, with measureless
    imprecations he shouted\nout: \"Aye, aye! and I'll chase him round Good Hope,
    and round the\nHorn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition's flames\nbefore
    I give him up. And this is what ye have shipped for, men! to\nchase that white
    whale on both sides of land, and over all sides of\nearth, till he spouts black
    blood and rolls fin out. What say ye, men,\nwill ye splice hands on it, now?
    I think ye do look brave.\"\n  \"Aye, aye!\" shouted the harpooneers and seamen,
    running closer to\nthe excited old man: \"A sharp eye for the white whale; a
    sharp lance\nfor Moby Dick!\"\n  \"God bless ye,\" he seemed to half sob and
    half shout. \"God bless ye,\nmen. Steward! go draw the great measure of grog.
    But what's this\nlong face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white
    whale!\nart not game for Moby Dick?\"\n  \"I am game for his crooked jaw, and
    for the jaws of Death too,\nCaptain Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the
    business we follow;\nbut I came here to hunt whales, not my commander's vengeance.
    How many\nbarrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain\nAhab?
    it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.\"\n  \"Nantucket market!
    Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a\nlittle lower layer. If money's
    to be the measurer, man, and the\naccountants have computed their great counting-house
    the globe, by\ngirdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch;
    then,\nlet me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here!\"\n 
    \"He smites his chest,\" whispered Stubb, \"what's that for? methinks\nit rings
    most vast, but hollow.\"\n  \"Vengeance on a dumb brute!\" cried Starbuck, \"that
    simply smote thee\nfrom blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb
    thing,\nCaptain Ahab, seems blasphemous.\"\n  \"Hark ye yet again- the little
    lower layer. All visible objects,\nman, are but as pasteboard masks. But in each
    event- in the living\nact, the undoubted deed- there, some unknown but still
    reasoning thing\nputs forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning\nmask.
    If man will strike, strike though the mask! How can the prisoner\nreach outside
    except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white\nwhale is that wall, shoved
    near to me. Sometimes I think there's\nnaught beyond. But 'tis enough. He tasks
    me; he heaps me; I see in him\noutrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice
    sinewing it. That\ninscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white
    whale\nagent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon\nhim.
    Talk not to me of blasphemy, man; I'd strike the sun if it\ninsulted me. For
    could the sun do that, then could I do the other;\nsince there is ever a sort
    of fair play herein, jealousy presiding\nover all creations. But not my master,
    man, is even that fair play.\nWho's over me? Truth hath no confines. Take off
    thine eye! more\nintolerable than fiends' glarings is a doltish stare! So, so;
    thou\nreddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow. But\nlook
    ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays itself.\nThere are men
    from whom warm words are small indignity. I meant not to\nincense thee. Let it
    go. Look! see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted\ntawn- living, breathing pictures
    painted by the sun. The Pagan\nleopards- the unrecking and unworshipping things,
    that live; and seek,\nand give no reasons for the torrid life they feel! The
    crew, man,\nthe crew! Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this matter of the\nwhale?
    See Stubb! he laughs! See yonder Chilian! he snorts to think of\nit. Stand up
    amid the general hurricane, thy one tost sapling\ncannot, Starbuck! And what
    is it? Reckon it. 'Tis but to help strike a\nfin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck.
    What is it more? From this one\npoor hunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket,
    surely he will\nnot hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone.\nAh!
    constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow lifts thee! Speak, but\nspeak!- Aye,
    aye! thy silence, then, that voices thee. (Aside)\nSomething shot from my dilated
    nostrils, he has inhaled it in his\nlungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose
    me now, without rebellion.\"\n  \"God keep me!- keep us all!\" murmured Starbuck,
    lowly.\n  But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate,\nAhab
    did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh\nfrom the hold;
    nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the\ncordage; nor yet the hollow
    flap of the sails against the masts, as\nfor a moment their hearts sank in. For
    again Starbuck's downcast\neyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life; the
    subterranean\nlaugh died away; the winds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship\nheaved
    and rolled as before. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay\nye not when
    ye come? But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye\nshadows! Yet not so
    much predictions from without, as verifications of\nthe fore-going things within.
    For with little external to constrain\nus, the innermost necessities in our being,
    these still drive us on.\n  \"The measure! the measure!\" cried Ahab.\n  Receiving
    the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he\nordered them to produce
    their weapons. Then ranging them before him\nnear the capstan, with their harpoons
    in their hands, while his\nthree mates stood at his side with their lances, and
    the rest of the\nship's company formed a circle round the group; he stood for
    an\ninstant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew. But those wild\neyes met
    his, as the bloodshot eves of the prairie wolves meet the eye\nof their leader,
    ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the\nbison; but, alas! only to
    fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.\n  \"Drink and pass!\" he cried, handing
    the heavy charged flagon to\nthe nearest seaman. \"The crew alone now drink.
    Round with it, round!\nShort draughts- long swallows, men; 'tis hot as Satan's
    hoof. So,\nso; it goes round excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the\nserpent-snapping
    eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went,\nthis way it comes. Hand it
    me- here's a hollow! Men, ye seem the\nyears; so brimming life is gulped and
    gone. Steward, refill!\n  \"Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round
    this capstan;\nand ye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand\nthere
    with your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I\nmay in some sort
    revive a noble custom of my fishermen fathers\nbefore me. O men, you will yet
    see that- Ha! boy, come back? bad\npennies come not sooner. Hand it me. Why,
    now, this pewter had run\nbrimming again, wert not thou St. Vitus' imp- away,
    thou ague!\n  \"Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done!
    Let\nme touch the axis.\" So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three\nlevel,
    radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing,\nsuddenly and nervously
    twitched them; meanwhile glancing intently from\nStarbuck to Stubb; from Stubb
    to Flask. It seemed as though, by some\nnameless, interior volition, he would
    fain have shocked into them\nthe same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden
    jar of his own\nmagnetic life. The three mates quailed before his strong, sustained,\nand
    mystic aspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him; the\nhonest eye of Starbuck
    fell downright.\n  \"In vain!\" cried Ahab; \"but, maybe, 'tis well. For did
    ye three\nbut once take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing,\nthat
    had perhaps expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have\ndropped ye dead.
    Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye\nmates, I do appoint ye three
    cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen\nthere- yon three most honorable gentlemen
    and noblemen, my valiant\nharpooneers. Disdain the task? What, when the great
    Pope washes the\nfeet of beggars, using his tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals!\nyour
    own condescension, that shall bend ye to it. I do not order ye;\nye will it.
    Cut your seizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!\"\n  Silently obeying the
    order, the three harpooneers now stood with the\ndetached iron part of their
    harpoons, some three feet long, held,\nbarbs up, before him.\n  \"Stab me not
    with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know\nye not the goblet end?
    Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye\ncup-bearers, advance. The irons! take them;
    hold them while I fill!\"\nForthwith, slowly going from one officer to the other,
    he brimmed\nthe harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.\n  \"Now,
    three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices!\nBestow them, ye who
    are now made parties to this indissoluble\nleague. Ha! Starbuck! but the deed
    is done! Yon ratifying sun now\nwaits to sit upon it. Drink, ye harpooneers!
    drink and swear, ye men\nthat man the deathful whaleboat's bow- Death to Moby
    Dick! God hunt us\nall, if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death!\" The long,
    barbed steel\ngoblets were lifted; and to cries and maledictions against the
    white\nwhale, the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss.\nStarbuck
    paled, and turned, and shivered. Once more, and finally,\nthe replenished pewter
    went the rounds among the frantic crew; when,\nwaving his free hand to them,
    they all dispersed; and Ahab retired\nwithin his cabin.\n  "
