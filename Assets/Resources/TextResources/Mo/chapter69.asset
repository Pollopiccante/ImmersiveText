  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 70,   The Sphynx
  content: "\n  Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall,\nnewlanded
    mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.\n  When on that shivering winter's
    night, the Pequod thrust her\nvindictive bows into the cold malicious waves,
    who should I see\nstanding at her helm but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic
    awe and\nfearfulness upon the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four\nyears'
    dangerous voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still\nanother tempestuous
    term. The land seemed scorching to his feet.\nWonderfullest things are ever the
    unmentionable; deep memories yield\nno epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the
    stoneless grave of\nBulkington. Let me only say that it fared with him as with
    the\nstorm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward land. The\nport
    would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is\nsafety, comfort,
    hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all\nthat's kind to our mortalities.
    But in that gale, the port, the\nland, is that ship's direst jeopardy; she must
    fly all hospitality;\none touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would
    make her\nshudder through and through. With all her might she crowds all sail\noff
    shore; in so doing, fights 'gainst the very winds that fain\nwould blow her homeward;
    seeks all the lashed sea's landlessness\nagain; for refuge's sake forlornly rushing
    into peril; her only friend\nher bitterest foe!\n  Know ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses
    do ye seem to see of that mortally\nintolerable truth; that all deep, earnest
    thinking is but the intrepid\neffort of the soul to keep the open independence
    of her sea; while the\nwildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her
    on the\ntreacherous, slavish shore?\n  But as in landlessness alone resides highest
    truth, shoreless,\nindefinite as God- so better is it to perish in that howling
    infinite,\nthan be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety!\nFor
    worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of\nthe terrible!
    is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O\nBulkington! Bear thee grimly,
    demigod! Up from the spray of thy\nocean-perishing- straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!\n  "
