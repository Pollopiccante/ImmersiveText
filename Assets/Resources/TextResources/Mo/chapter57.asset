  content: "\n  \"Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?\"\n  Queequeg and I had
    just left the Pequod, and were sauntering from\nthe water, for the moment each
    occupied with his own thoughts, when\nthe above words were put to us by a stranger,
    who, pausing before\nus, levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question.
    He\nwas but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a\nrag
    of a black handkerchief investing his neck. A confluent smallpox\nhad in all
    directions flowed over his face, and left it like the\ncomplicated ribbed bed
    of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been\ndried up.\n  \"Have ye shipped
    in her?\" he repeated.\n  \"You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,\" said I, trying
    to gain a\nlittle more time for an uninterrupted look at him.\n  \"Aye, the Pequod-
    that ship there,\" he said, drawing back his\nwhole arm and then rapidly shoving
    it straight out from him-, with the\nfixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted
    full at the object.\n  \"Yes,\" said I, \"we have just signed the articles.\"\n 
    \"Anything down there about your souls?\"\n  \"About what?\"\n  \"Oh, perhaps
    you hav'n't got any,\" he said quickly. \"No matter\nthough, I know many chaps
    that hav'n't got any,- good luck to 'em; and\nthey are all the better off for
    it. A soul's a sort of a fifth wheel\nto a wagon.\"\n  \"What are you jabbering
    about, shipmate?\" said I.\n  \"He's got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies
    of that\nsort in other chaps,\" abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous\nemphasis
    upon the word he.\n  \"Queequeg,\" said I, \"let's go; this fellow has broken
    loose from\nsomewhere; he's talking about something and somebody we don't know.\"\n 
    \"Stop!\" cried the stranger. \"Ye said true- ye hav'n't seen Old\nThunder yet,
    have ye?\"\n  \"Who's Old Thunder?\" said I, again riveted with the insane\nearnestness
    of his manner.\n  \"Captain Ahab.\"\n  \"What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?\"\n 
    \"Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye\nhav'n't seen
    him yet, have ye?\"\n  \"No, we hav'n't. He's sick they say, but is getting better,
    and will\nbe all right again before long.\"\n  \"All right again before long!\"
    laughed the stranger, with a solemnly\nderisive sort of laugh. \"Look ye; when
    Captain Ahab is all right, then\nthis left arm of mine will be all right; not
    before.\"\n  \"What do you know about him?\"\n  \"What did they tell you about
    him? Say that!\"\n  \"They didn't tell much of anything about him; only I've
    heard that\nhe's a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.\"\n  \"That's
    true, that's true- yes, both true enough. But you must\njump when he gives an
    order. Step and growl; growl and go- that's\nthe word with Captain Ahab. But
    nothing about that thing that happened\nto him off Cape Horn, long ago, when
    he lay like dead for three days\nand nights; nothing about that deadly skrimmage
    with the Spaniard\nafore the altar in Santa?- heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing
    about\nthe silver calabash he spat into? And nothing about his losing his leg\nlast
    voyage, according to the prophecy. Didn't ye hear a word about\nthem matters
    and something more, eh? No, I don't think ye did; how\ncould ye? Who knows it?
    Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows'ever,\nmayhap, ye've heard tell about the
    leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye\nhave heard of that, I dare say. Oh, yes, that
    every one knows\na'most- I mean they know he's only one leg; and that a parmacetti
    took\nthe other off.\"\n  \"My friend,\" said I, \"what all this gibberish of
    yours is about, I\ndon't know, and I don't much care; for it seems to me that
    you must be\na little damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain
    Ahab,\nof that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know\nall
    about the loss of his leg.\"\n  \"All about it, eh- sure you do? all?\n  \"Pretty
    sure.\"\n  With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the\nbeggar-like
    stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then\nstarting a little,
    turned and said:- \"Ye've shipped, have ye? Names\ndown on the papers? Well,
    well, what's signed, is signed; and what's\nto be, will be; and then again, perhaps
    it won't be, after all. Any\nhow, it's all fixed and arranged already; and some
    sailors or other\nmust go with him, I suppose; as well these as any other men,
    God\npity 'em! Morning to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens\nbless
    ye; I'm sorry I stopped ye.\"\n  \"Look here, friend,\" said I, \"if you have
    anything important to tell\nus, out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle
    us, you are\nmistaken in your game; that's all I have to say.\"\n  \"And it's
    said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that\nway; you are just the
    man for him- the likes of ye. Morning to ye,\nshipmates, morning! Oh! when ye
    get there, tell 'em I've concluded not\nto make one of 'em.\"\n  \"Ah, my dear
    fellow, you can't fool us that way- you can't fool\nus. It is the easiest thing
    in the world for a man to look as if he\nhad a great secret in him.\"\n  \"Morning
    to ye, shipmates, morning.\"\n  \"Morning it is,\" said I. \"Come along, Queequeg,
    let's leave this\ncrazy man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?\"\n  \"Elijah.\"\n 
    Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each\nother's fashion,
    upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was\nnothing but a humbug, trying
    to be a bugbear. But we had not gone\nperhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing
    to turn a corner, and\nlooking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah
    following\nus, though at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck me so,
    that\nI said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with\nmy
    comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same\ncorner that
    we did. He did; and then it seemed to me that he was\ndogging us, but with what
    intent I could not for the life of me\nimagine. This circumstance, coupled with
    his ambiguous,\nhalf-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk, now begat
    in me\nall kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all\nconnected
    with the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the leg he had\nlost; and the Cape Horn
    fit; and the silver calabash; and what Captain\nPeleg had said of him, when I
    left the ship the day previous; and\nthe prediction of the squaw Tistig; and
    the voyage we had bound\nourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy things.\n 
    I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was\nreally dogging
    us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with\nQueequeg, and on that side
    of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed\non, without seeming to notice us.
    This relieved me; and once more, and\nfinally as it seemed to me, I pronounced
    him in my heart, a humbug.\n  "
