  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 130,   The Hat
  content: "\n  \"HIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?\n  It was the middle-watch:
    a fair moonlight; the seamen were\nstanding in a cordon, extending from one of
    the fresh-water butts in\nthe waist, to the scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In
    this manner, they\npassed the buckets to fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for
    the most\npart, on the hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful\nnot
    to speak or rustle their feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went\nin the deepest
    silence, only broken by the occasional flap of a\nsail, and the steady hum of
    the unceasingly advancing keel.\n  It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy,
    one of the cordon,\nwhose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor,
    a\nCholo, the words above.\n  \"Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?\"\n  \"Take
    the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d'ye mean?\"\n  \"There it is again- under
    the hatches- don't you hear it- a cough-\nit sounded like a cough.\"\n  \"Cough
    be damned! Pass along that return bucket.\"\n  \"There again- there it is!- it
    sounds like two or three sleepers\nturning over, now!\"\n  \"Caramba! have done,
    shipmate, will ye? It's the three soaked\nbiscuits ye eat for supper turning
    over inside of ye- nothing else.\nLook to the bucket!\"\n  \"Say what ye will,
    shipmate; I've sharp ears.\"\n  \"Aye, you are the chap, ain't ye, that heard
    the hum of the old\nQuakeress's knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket;
    you're\nthe chap.\"\n  \"Grin away; we'll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco,
    there is\nsomebody down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck;\nand
    I suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb\ntell Flask,
    one morning watch, that there was something of that sort\nin the wind.\"\n  \"Tish!
    the bucket!\"\n  "
