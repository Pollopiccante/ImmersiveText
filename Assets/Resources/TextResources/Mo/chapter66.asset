  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 67,   Cutting In
  content: "\n  At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship's\nriggers,
    and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf,\nand after the ever-thoughtful
    Charity had come off in a whale-boat,\nwith her last gift- a nightcap for Stubb,
    the second mate, her\nbrother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward- after
    all this, the\ntwo Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning\nto
    the chief mate, Peleg said:\n  \"Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is
    right? Captain Ahab\nis all ready- just spoke to him- nothing more to be got
    from shore,\neh? Well, call all hands, then. Muster 'em aft here- blast 'em!\"\n 
    \"No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,\" said\nBildad, \"but
    away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.\"\n  How now! Here upon
    the very point of starting for the voyage,\nCaptain Peleg and Captain Bildad
    were going it with a high hand on the\nquarter-deck, just as if they were to
    be joint-commanders at sea, as\nwell as to all appearances in port. And, as for
    Captain Ahab, no\nsign of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the
    cabin.\nBut then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in\ngetting
    the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea.\nIndeed, as that was
    not at all his proper business, but the pilot's;\nand as he was not yet completely
    recovered- so they said- therefore,\nCaptain Ahab stayed below. And all this
    seemed natural enough;\nespecially as in the merchant service many captains never
    show\nthemselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the\nanchor,
    but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell\nmerry-making with their shore
    friends, before they quit the ship for\ngood with the pilot.\n  But there was
    not much chance to think over the matter, for\nCaptain Peleg was now all alive.
    He seemed to do most of the talking\nand commanding, and not Bildad.\n  \"Aft
    here, ye sons of bachelors,\" he cried, as the sailors\nlingered at the main-mast.
    \"Mr. Starbuck, drive aft.\"\n  \"Strike the tent there!\"- was the next order.
    As I hinted before,\nthis whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port;
    and on\nboard the Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was\nwell
    known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.\n  \"Man the capstan! Blood
    and thunder!- jump!\"- was the next\ncommand, and the crew sprang for the handspikes.\n 
    Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the\npilot is the
    forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with\nPeleg, be it known, in
    addition to his other officers, was one of\nthe licensed pilots of the port-
    he being suspected to have got\nhimself made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket
    pilot-fee to all\nthe ships he was concerned in, for he never piloted any other
    craft-\nBildad, I say, might now be seen actively engaged in looking over\nthe
    bows for the approaching anchor, and at intervals singing what\nseemed a dismal
    stave of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass,\nwho roared forth some
    sort of chorus about the girls in Booble\nAlley, with hearty good will. Nevertheless,
    not three days previous,\nBildad had told them that no profane songs would be
    allowed on board\nthe Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and Charity,
    his\nsister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seaman's\nberth.\n 
    Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg\nripped and swore
    astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought\nhe would sink the ship
    before the anchor could be got up;\ninvoluntarily I paused on my handspike, and
    told Queequeg to do the\nsame, thinking of the perils we both ran, in starting
    on the voyage\nwith such a devil for a pilot. I was comforting myself, however,\nwith
    the thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation,\nspite of his
    seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a\nsudden sharp poke in my
    rear, and turning round, was horrified at\nthe apparition of Captain Peleg in
    the art of withdrawing his leg from\nmy immediate vicinity. That was my first
    kick.\n  \"Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?\" he roared.\n\"Spring,
    thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don't ye\nspring, I say,
    all of ye- spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the\nred whiskers; spring there,
    Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants.\nSpring, I say, all of ye, and spring your
    eyes out!\" And so saying, he\nmoved along the windlass, here and there using
    his leg very freely,\nwhile imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody.\nThinks
    I, Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.\n  At last the anchor
    was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It\nwas a short, cold Christmas;
    and as the short northern day merged into\nnight, we found ourselves almost broad
    upon the wintry ocean, whose\nfreezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished
    armor. The long rows of\nteeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and
    like the white\nivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended\nfrom
    the bows.\n  Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon,
    as\nthe old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering\nfrost
    all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his\nsteady notes were
    heard,-\n\n             \"Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,\n               
    Stand dressed in living green.\n              So to the Jews old Canaan stood,\n               
    While Jordan rolled between.\"\n\n  Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly
    to me than then. They\nwere full of hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter
    night in\nthe boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there\nwas
    yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and\nmeads and glades
    so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the\nspring, untrodden, unwilted,
    remains at midsummer.\n  At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots
    were needed no\nlonger. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging\nalongside.\n 
    It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were\naffected at this
    juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to\ndepart, yet; very loath to
    leave, for good, a ship bound on so long\nand perilous a voyage- beyond both
    stormy Capes; a ship in which\nsome thousands of his hardearned dollars were
    invested; a ship, in\nwhich an old shipmate sailed as captain; a man almost as
    old as he,\nonce more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw;\nloath
    to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful of every\ninterest to him,- poor
    old Bildad lingered long; paced the deck with\nanxious strides; ran down into
    the cabin to speak another farewell\nword there; again came on deck, and looked
    to windward; looked towards\nthe wide and endless waters, only bound by the far-off
    unseen\nEastern Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft; looked\nright
    and left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last,\nmechanically coiling a
    rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout\nPeleg by the hand, and holding
    up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing\nheroically in his face, as much as to
    say, \"Nevertheless, friend\nPeleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.\"\n  As for Peleg
    himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for\nall his philosophy, there
    was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the\nlantern came too near. And he, too,
    did not a little run from the\ncabin to deck- now a word below, and now a word
    with Starbuck, the\nchief mate.\n  But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with
    a final sort of look\nabout him,- \"Captain Bildad- come, old shipmate, we must
    go. Back\nthe mainyard there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside,\nnow!
    Careful, careful!- come, Bildad, boy- say your last. Luck to\nye, Starbuck- luck
    to ye, Mr. Stubb- luck to ye, Mr. Flask- good-bye\nand good luck to ye all- and
    this day three years I'll have a hot\nsupper smoking for ye in old Nantucket.
    Hurrah and away!\"\n  \"God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,\"
    murmured old\nBildad, almost incoherently. \"I hope ye'll have fine weather now,
    so\nthat Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye- a pleasant sun is all\nhe
    needs, and ye'll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. Be\ncareful
    in the hunt, ye mates. Don't stave the boats needlessly, ye\nharpooneers; good
    white cedar plank is raised full three per cent\nwithin the year. Don't forget
    your prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck, mind\nthat cooper don't waste the spare staves.
    Oh! the sail-needles are\nin the green locker. Don't whale it too much a' Lord's
    days, men;\nbut don't miss a fair chance either, that's rejecting Heaven's good\ngifts.
    Have an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a\nlittle leaky, I thought.
    If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask, beware\nof fornication. Good-bye, good-bye!
    Don't keep that cheese too long\ndown in the hold, Mr. Starbuck; it'll spoil.
    Be careful with the\nbutter- twenty cents the pound it was, and mind ye, if--\"\n 
    \"Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,- away!\" and with that,\nPeleg
    hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.\n  Ship and boat diverged;
    the cold, damp night breeze blew between;\na screaming gull flew overhead; the
    two hulls wildly rolled; we gave\nthree heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged
    like fate into the\nlone Atlantic.\n  "
