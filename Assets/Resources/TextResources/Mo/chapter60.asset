  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 61,   Stubb Kills a Whale
  content: "\n  A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod.\nNot
    only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on\nboard, and
    bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything\nbetokened that the
    ship's preparations were hurrying to a close.\nCaptain Peleg seldom or never
    went ashore, but sat in his wigwam\nkeeping a sharp look-out upon the hands:
    Bildad did all the purchasing\nand providing at the stores; and the men employed
    in the hold and on\nthe rigging were working till long after night-fall.\n  On
    the day following Queequeg's signing the articles, word was given\nat all the
    inns where the ship's company were stopping, that their\nchests must be on board
    before night, for there was no telling how\nsoon the vessel might be sailing.
    So Queequeg and I got down our\ntraps, resolving, however, to sleep ashore till
    the last. But it seems\nthey always give very long notice in these cases, and
    the ship did not\nsail for several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal
    to be\ndone, and there is no telling how many things to be thought of, before\nthe
    Pequod was fully equipped.\n  Every one knows what a multitude of things- beds,
    sauce-pans, knives\nand forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and
    what not, are\nindispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling,\nwhich
    necessitates a three-years' housekeeping upon the wide ocean,\nfar from all grocers,
    costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And\nthough this also holds true
    of merchant vessels, yet not by any\nmeans to the same extent as with whalemen.
    For besides the great\nlength of the whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar
    to the\nprosecution of the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at\nthe
    remote harbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, that\nof all ships,
    whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all\nkinds, and especially
    to the destruction and loss of the very things\nupon which the success of the
    voyage most depends. Hence, the spare\nboats, spare spars, and spare lines and
    harpoons, and spare\neverythings, almost, but a spare Captain and duplicate ship.\n 
    At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage\nof the Pequod
    had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread,\nwater, fuel, and iron
    hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for\nsome time there was a continual
    fetching and carrying on board of\ndivers odds and ends of things, both large
    and small.\n  Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain\nBildad's
    sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and\nindefatigable spirit, but withal
    very kindhearted, who seemed resolved\nthat, if she could help it, nothing should
    be found wanting in the\nPequod, after once fairly getting to sea. At one time
    she would come\non board with a jar of pickles for the steward's pantry; another\ntime
    with a bunch of quills for the chief mate's desk, where he kept\nhis log; a third
    time with a roll of flannel for the small of some\none's rheumatic back. Never
    did any woman better deserve her name,\nwhich was Charity- Aunt Charity, as everybody
    called her. And like a\nsister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle
    about hither\nand thither, ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that\npromised
    to yield safety, comfort, and consolation to all on board a\nship in which her
    beloved brother Bildad was concerned, and in which\nshe herself owned a score
    or two of well-saved dollars.\n  But it was startling to see this excellent hearted
    Quakeress\ncoming on board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in
    one\nhand, and still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad\nhimself
    nor Captain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried\nabout with him
    a long list of the articles needed, and at every\nfresh arrival, down went his
    mark opposite that article upon the\npaper. Every once in a while Peleg came
    hobbling out of his\nwhalebone den, roaring at the men down the hatchways, roaring
    up to\nthe riggers at the mast-head, and then concluded by roaring back\ninto
    his wigwam.\n  During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited
    the\ncraft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and\nwhen
    he was going to come on board his ship. To these questions they\nwould answer,
    that he was getting better and better, and was\nexpected aboard every day; meantime,
    the two captains, Peleg and\nBildad, could attend to everything necessary to
    fit the vessel for the\nvoyage. If I had been downright honest with myself, I
    would have\nseen very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being\ncommitted
    this way to so long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on\nthe man who was
    to be absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship\nsailed out upon the open
    sea. But when a man suspects any wrong, it\nsometimes happens that if he be already
    involved in the matter, he\ninsensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even
    from himself. And\nmuch this way it was with me. I said nothing, and tried to
    think\nnothing.\n  At last it was given out that some time next day the ship
    would\ncertainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early\nstart.\n  "
