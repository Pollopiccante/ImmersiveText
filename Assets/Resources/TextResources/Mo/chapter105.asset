  content: "\n  It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with\nthe
    other seamen my first mast-head came round.\n  In most American whalemen the
    mast-heads are manned almost\nsimultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port;
    even though she may\nhave fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching
    her proper\ncruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years' voyage\nshe
    is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her- say, an empty\nvial even- then,
    her mast-heads are kept manned to the last! and not\ntill her skysail-poles sail
    in among the spires of the port, does\nshe altogether relinquish the hope of
    capturing one whale more.\n  Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore
    or afloat, is\na very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate\nhere.
    I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old\nEgyptians;
    because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.\nFor though their progenitors,
    the builders of Babel, must doubtless,\nby their tower, have intended to rear
    the loftiest mast-head in all\nAsia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck
    was put to it) as\nthat great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by
    the board,\nin the dread gale of God's wrath; therefore, we cannot give these\nBabel
    builders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians\nwere a nation of
    mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the\ngeneral belief among archaeologists,
    that the first pyramids were\nfounded for astronomical purposes: a theory singularly
    supported by\nthe peculiar stairlike formation of all four sides of those\nedifices;
    whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of their legs,\nthose old astronomers
    were wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for\nnew stars; even as the look-outs
    of a modern ship sing out for a sail,\nor a whale just bearing in sight. In Saint
    Stylites, the famous\nChristian hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone
    pillar in\nthe desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its\nsummit,
    hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle; in him we\nhave a remarkable
    instance of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who\nwas not to be driven from
    his place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail,\nor sleet; but valiantly facing everything
    out to the last, literally\ndied at his post. Of modern standers-of-mast-heads
    we have but a\nlifeless set; mere stone, iron, and bronze men; who, though well\ncapable
    of facing out a stiff gale, are still entirely incompetent\nto the business of
    singing out upon discovering any strange sight.\nThere is Napoleon; who, upon
    the top of the column of Vendome stands\nwith arms folded, some one hundred and
    fifty feet in the air;\ncareless, now, who rules the decks below, whether Louis
    Philippe,\nLouis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high\naloft
    on his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of\nHercules' pillars, his
    column marks that point of human grandeur\nbeyond which few mortals will go.
    Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan\nof gun-metal, stands his mast-head in Trafalgar
    Square; and even\nwhen most obscured by that London smoke, token is yet given
    that a\nhidden hero is there; for where there is smoke, must be fire. But\nneither
    great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a\nsingle hail from below,
    however madly invoked to befriend by their\ncounsels the distracted decks upon
    which they gaze; however it may\nbe surmised, that their spirits penetrate through
    the thick haze of\nthe future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be
    shunned.\n  It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head\nstanders
    of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is\nnot so, is plainly
    evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\nhistorian of Nantucket, stands
    accountable. The worthy Obed tells\nus, that in the early times of the whale
    fishery, ere ships were\nregularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people
    of that island\nerected lofty spars along the seacoast, to which the look-outs\nascended
    by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs\nin a hen-house. A
    few years ago this same plan was adopted by the\nBay whalemen of New Zealand,
    who, upon descrying the game, gave notice\nto the ready-manned boats nigh the
    beach. But this custom has now\nbecome obsolete; turn we then to the one proper
    mast-head, that of a\nwhale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are kept manned
    from\nsun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at\nthe
    helm), and relieving each other every two hours. In the serene\nweather of the
    tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head:\nnay, to a dreamy meditative
    man it is delightful. There you stand, a\nhundred feet above the silent decks,
    striding along the deep, as if\nthe masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath
    you and between your\nlegs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea,
    even as ships\nonce sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes.\nThere
    you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with\nnothing ruffled but
    the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls;\nthe drowsy trade winds blow; everything
    resolves you into languor. For\nthe most part, in this tropic whaling life, a
    sublime uneventfulness\ninvests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras
    with startling\naccounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary\nexcitements;
    you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities;\nfall of stocks; are
    never troubled with the thought of what you\nshall have for dinner- for all your
    meals for three years and more are\nsnugly stowed in casks, and your bill of
    fare is immutable.\n  In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or
    four years'\nvoyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend
    at\nthe mast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to\nbe
    deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a\nportion of the
    whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly\ndestitute of anything approaching
    to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted\nto breed a comfortable localness of feeling,
    such as pertains to a\nbed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach,
    or any\nother of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily\nisolate
    themselves. Your most usual point of perch is the head of\nthe t' gallant-mast,
    where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks\n(almost peculiar to whalemen)
    called the t' gallant crosstrees.\nHere, tossed about by the sea, the beginner
    feels about as cosy as\nhe would standing on a bull's horns. To be sure, in cold
    weather you\nmay carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a watch-coat;
    but\nproperly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more of a house than\nthe
    unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy\ntabernacle, and cannot
    freely move about in it, nor even move out of\nit, without running great risk
    of perishing (like an ignorant\npilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so
    a watch-coat is not\nso much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional
    skin\nencasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body,\nand
    no more can you make a convenience closet of your watch-coat.\n  Concerning all
    this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads\nof a southern whale ship
    are unprovided with those enviable little\ntents or pulpits, called crow's-nests,
    in which the look-outs of a\nGreenland whaler are protected from the inclement
    weather of the\nfrozen seas. In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled
    \"A\nVoyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and\nincidentally
    for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of\nOld Greenland;\" in this
    admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads\nare furnished with a charmingly
    circumstantial account of the then\nrecently invented crow's-nest of the Glacier,
    which was the name of\nCaptain Sleet's good craft. He called it the Sleet's crow's-nest,
    in\nhonor of himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and\nfree
    from all ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call\nour own children
    after our own names (we fathers being the original\ninventors and patentees),
    so likewise should we denominate after\nourselves any other apparatus we may
    beret. In shape, the Sleet's\ncrow's-nest is something like a large tierce or
    pipe; it is open\nabove, however, where it is furnished with a movable sidescreen
    to\nkeep to windward of your head in a hard gale. Being fixed on the\nsummit
    of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch\nin the bottom. On
    the after side, or side next the stern of the\nship, is a comfortable seat, with
    a locker underneath for umbrellas,\ncomforters, and coats. In front is a leather
    rack, in which to keep\nyour speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical\nconveniences.
    When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this\ncrow's-nest of his,
    he tells us that he always had a rifle with him\n(also fixed in the rack), together
    with a powder flask and shot, for\nthe purpose of popping off the stray narwhales,
    or vagrant sea\nunicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully
    shoot\nat them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to\nshoot
    down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it was plainly\na labor of love
    for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the\nlittle detailed conveniences
    of his crow's-nest; but though he so\nenlarges upon many of these, and though
    he treats us to a very\nscientific account of his experiments in this crow's-nest,
    with a\nsmall compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the\nerrors
    resulting from what is called the \"local attraction\" of all\nbinnacle magnets;
    an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of\nthe iron in the ship's planks,
    and in the Glacier's case, perhaps,\nto there having been so many broken-down
    blacksmiths among her crew; I\nsay, that though the Captain is very discreet
    and scientific here,\nyet, for all his learned \"binnacle deviations,\" \"azimuth
    compass\nobservations,\" and \"approximate errors,\" he knows very well, Captain\nSleet,
    that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic\nmeditations, as
    to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well\nreplenished little case-bottle,
    so nicely tucked in on one side of his\ncrow's nest, within easy reach of his
    hand. Though, upon the whole,\nI greatly admire and even love the brave, the
    honest, and learned\nCaptain; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so
    utterly\nignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter\nit
    must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded head he\nwas studying
    the mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest within\nthree or four perches
    of the pole.\n  But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft
    as\nCaptain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is\ngreatly
    counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those\nseductive seas
    in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used\nto lounge up the rigging
    very leisurely, resting in the top to have\na chat with Queequeg, or any one
    else off duty whom I might find\nthere; then ascending a little way further,
    and throwing a lazy leg\nover the top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the
    watery\npastures, and so at last mount to my ultimate destination.\n  Let me
    make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept\nbut sorry guard.
    With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how\ncould I- being left completely
    to myself at such a thought-engendering\naltitude- how could I but lightly hold
    my obligations to observe all\nwhaleships' standing orders, \"Keep your weather
    eye open, and sing out\nevery time.\"\n  And let me in this place movingly admonish
    you, ye ship-owners of\nNantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries
    any lad with\nlean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness;
    and\nwho offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his head.\nBeware
    of such an one, I say: your whales must be seen before they can\nbe killed; and
    this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes\nround the world, and
    never make you one pint of sperm the richer.\nNor are these monitions at all
    unneeded. For nowadays, the\nwhale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic,
    melancholy, and\nabsent-minded young men, disgusted with the corking care of
    earth, and\nseeking sentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently\nperches
    himself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed\nwhale-ship, and in
    moody phrase  ejaculates:-\n\n     \"Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean,
    roll!\n      Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.\"\n\nVery
    often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded\nyoung philosophers
    to task, upbraiding them with not feeling\nsufficient \"interest\" in the voyage;
    half-hinting that they are so\nhopelessly lost to all honorable ambition, as
    that in their secret\nsouls they would rather not see whales than otherwise.
    But all in\nvain; those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is\nimperfect;
    they are short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the\nvisual nerve? They have
    left their opera-glasses at home.\n  \"Why, thou monkey,\" said a harpooneer
    to one of these lads, \"we've\nbeen cruising now hard upon three years, and thou
    hast not raised a\nwhale yet. Whales are scarce as hen's teeth whenever thou
    art up\nhere.\" Perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of\nthem
    in the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like\nlistlessness of vacant,
    unconscious reverie is this absent-minded\nyouth by the blending cadence of waves
    with thoughts, that at last\nhe loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at
    his feet for the\nvisible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading
    mankind\nand nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing\nthat
    eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some\nundiscernible form,
    seems to him the embodiment of those elusive\nthoughts that only people the soul
    by continually flitting through it.\nIn this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs
    away to whence it came;\nbecomes diffused through time and space; like Crammer's
    sprinkled\nPantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of every shore the round\nglobe
    over.\n  There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted\nby
    a gentle rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea,\nfrom the inscrutable
    tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is\non ye, move your foot or hand
    an inch; slip your hold at all; and your\nidentity comes back in horror. Over
    Descartian vortices you hover. And\nperhaps, at midday, in the fairest weather,
    with one half-throttled\nshriek you drop through that transparent air into the
    summer sea, no\nmore to rise for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!\n  "
