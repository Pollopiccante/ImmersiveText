  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 103,   Measurement of The Whale's Skeleton
  content: "\n  It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale\nloaf-of-bread
    face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his\nlord and master who, sitting
    in the lee quarter-boat, has just been\ntaking an observation of the sun; and
    is now mutely reckoning the\nlatitude on the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet,
    reserved for that\ndaily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg. From his
    complete\ninattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not\nheard
    his menial. But presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds,\nhe swings himself
    to the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice,\nsaying, \"Dinner, Mr. Starbuck,\"
    disappears into the cabin.\n  When the last echo of his sultan's step has died
    away, and Starbuck,\nthe first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated,
    then\nStarbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks,\nand,
    after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of\npleasantness,
    \"Dinner, Mr. Stubb,\" and descends the scuttle. The\nsecond Emir lounges about
    the rigging awhile, and then slightly\nshaking the main brace, to see whether
    it will be all right with\nthat important rope, he likewise takes up the old
    burden, and with a\nrapid \"Dinner, Mr. Flask,\" follows after his predecessors.\n 
    But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the\nquarter-deck, seems
    to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for,\ntipping all sorts of knowing
    winks in all sorts of directions, and\nkicking off his shoes, he strikes into
    a sharp but noiseless squall of\na hornpipe right over the Grand Turk's head;
    and then, by a\ndexterous sleight, pitching his cap up into the mizentop for
    a\nshelf, he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible\nfrom
    the deck, reversing all other processions, by bringing up the\nrear with music.
    But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below, he\npauses, ships a new face altogether,
    and, then, independent, hilarious\nlittle Flask enters King Ahab's presence,
    in the character of\nAbjectus, or the Slave.\n  It is not the least among the
    strange things bred by the intense\nartificialness of sea-usages, that while
    in the open air of the deck\nsome officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves
    boldly and\ndefyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those\nvery
    officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in\nthat same commander's
    cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to\nsay deprecatory and humble
    air towards him, as he sits at the head\nof the table; this is marvellous, sometimes
    most comical. Wherefore\nthis difference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been
    Belshazzar, King\nof Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but\ncourteously,
    therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane\ngrandeur. But he who
    in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit\npresides over his own private dinner-table
    of invited guests, that\nman's unchallenged power and dominion of individual
    influence for\nthe time; that man's royalty of state transcends Belshazzar's,
    for\nBelshazzar was not the greatest. Who has but once dined his friends,\nhas
    tasted what it is to be Caesar. It is a witchery of social\nczarship which there
    is no withstanding. Now, if to this consideration\nyou super-add the official
    supremacy of a ship-master, then, by\ninference, you will derive the cause of
    that peculiarity of sea-life\njust mentioned.\n  Over his ivory-inlaid table,
    Ahab presided like a mute, maned\nsea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded
    by his war-like but\nstill deferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer
    waited to\nbe served. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,\nthere
    seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one mind,\ntheir intent
    eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife, as he\ncarved the chief dish before
    him. I do not suppose that for the\nworld they would have profaned that moment
    with the slightest\nobservation, even upon so neutral a topic as the weather.
    No! And when\nreaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef
    was\nlocked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the mate\nreceived
    his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a\nlittle started
    if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate;\nand chewed it noiselessly;
    and swallowed it, not without\ncircumspection. For, like the Coronation banquet
    at Frankfort, where\nthe German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial\nelectors,
    so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in\nawful silence; and
    yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation;\nonly he himself was dumb. What
    a relief it was to choking Stubb,\nwhen a rat made a sudden racket in the hold
    below. And poor little\nFlask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this
    weary family\nparty. His were the shin-bones of the saline beef; his would have
    been\nthe drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help himself, this\nmust
    have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree. Had\nhe helped
    himself at the table, doubtless, never more would he have\nbeen able to hold
    his head up in this honest world; nevertheless,\nstrange to say, Ahab never forbade
    him. And had Flask helped\nhimself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as
    noticed it.\nLeast of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether\nhe
    thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of\nits clotting
    his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that,\non so long a voyage
    in such marketless waters, butter was at a\npremium, and therefore was not for
    him, a subaltern; however it was,\nFlask, alas! was a butterless man!\n  Another
    thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and\nFlask is the first
    man up. Consider! For hereby Flask's dinner was\nbadly jammed in point of time.
    Starbuck and Stubb both had the start\nof him; and yet they also have the privilege
    of lounging in the\nrear. If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask,
    happens to\nhave but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding
    his\nrepast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than\nthree
    mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to\nprecede Flask
    to the deck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted\nin private, that ever
    since he had arisen to the dignity of an\nofficer, from that moment he had never
    known what it was to be\notherwise than hungry, more or less. For what he ate
    did not so much\nrelieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him. Peace and\nsatisfaction,
    thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach. I\nam an officer; but,
    how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned\nbeef in the fore-castle, as I
    used to when I was before the mast.\nThere's the fruit of promotion now; there's
    the vanity of glory:\nthere's the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that
    any mere\nsailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask's official\ncapacity,
    all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample\nvengeance, was to go aft
    at dinnertime, and get a peep at Flask\nthrough the cabin sky-light, sitting
    silly and dumfoundered before\nawful Ahab.\n  Now, Ahab and his three mates formed
    what may be called the first\ntable in the Pequod's cabin. After their departure,
    taking place in\ninverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared,
    or\nrather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And\nthen
    the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its\nresiduary legatees.
    They made a sort of temporary servants' hall of\nthe high and mighty cabin.\n 
    In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and\nnameless invisible
    domineerings of the captain's table, was the entire\ncare-free license and ease,
    the almost frantic democracy of those\ninferior fellows the harpooneers. While
    their masters, the mates,\nseemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their
    own jaws, the\nharpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was
    a\nreport to it. They dined like lords; they filled their bellies like\nIndian
    ships all day loading with spices. Such portentous appetites\nhad Queequeg and
    Tashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by\nthe previous repast, often
    the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a\ngreat baron of salt-junk, seemingly
    quarried out of the solid ox.\nAnd if he were not lively about it, if he did
    not go with a nimble\nhop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way
    of\naccelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. And once\nDaggoo,
    seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory by\nsnatching him up
    bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty\nwooden trencher, while Tashtego,
    knife in hand, began laying out the\ncircle preliminary to scalping him. He was
    naturally a very nervous,\nshuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced
    steward; the\nprogeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse. And what with
    the\nstanding spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical\ntumultuous
    visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole\nlife was one continual
    lip-quiver. Commonly, after seeing the\nharpooneers furnished with all things
    they demanded, he would escape\nfrom their clutches into his little pantry adjoining,
    and fearfully\npeep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was
    over.\n  It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego,\nopposing
    his filed teeth to the Indian's; crosswise to them, Daggoo\nseated on the floor,
    for a bench would have brought his\nhearse-plumed head to the low carlines; at
    every motion of his\ncolossal limbs, making the low cabin framework to shake,
    as when an\nAfrican elephant goes passenger in a ship. But for all this, the
    great\nnegro was wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty. It seemed\nhardly
    possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could\nkeep up the vitality
    diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a\nperson. But, doubtless, this
    noble savage fed strong and drank deep of\nthe abounding element of air; and
    through his dilated nostrils snuffed\nin the sublime life of the worlds. Not
    by beef or by bread, are giants\nmade or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a mortal,
    barbaric smack of\nthe lip in eating- an ugly sound enough- so much so, that
    the\ntrembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth\nlurked
    in his own lean arms. And when he would hear Tashtego singing\nout for him to
    produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the\nsimple-witted steward all
    but shattered the crockery hanging round him\nin the pantry, by his sudden fits
    of the palsy. Nor did the\nwhetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets,
    for their\nlances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they\nwould
    ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did\nnot at all tend
    to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget\nthat in his Island days,
    Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been\nguilty of some murderous, convivial
    indiscretion. Alas! Dough-Boy!\nhard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals.
    Not a napkin\nshould he carry on his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though,
    to\nhis great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and\ndepart; to
    his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial\nbones jingling in them
    at every step, like Moorish scimetars in\nscabbards.\n  But, though these barbarians
    dined in the cabin, and nominally lived\nthere; still, being anything but sedentary
    in their habits, they\nwere scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just
    before\nsleeping-time, when they passed through it to their own peculiar\nquarters.\n 
    In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American\nwhale captains,
    who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by\nrights the ship's cabin
    belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy\nalone that anybody else is, at any
    time, permitted there. So that,\nin real truth, the mates and harpooneers of
    the Pequod might more\nproperly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in
    it. For when\nthey did enter it, it was something as a streetdoor enters a house;\nturning
    inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and,\nas a permanent thing,
    residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much\nhereby; in the cabin was no
    companionship; socially, Ahab was\ninaccessible. Though nominally included in
    the census of\nChristendom, he was still an alien to it. He lived in the world,
    as\nthe last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri. And as when\nSpring
    and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods,\nburying himself in the
    hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there,\nsucking his own paws; so, in his
    inclement, howling old age, Ahab's\nsoul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body,
    there fed upon the\nsullen paws of its gloom!\n  "
