  content: "\n  In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught
    but\nsubstantiated facts. But after embattling his facts, an advocate who\nshould
    wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell\neloquently upon
    his cause- such an advocate, would he not be\nblame-worthy?\n  It is well known
    that at the coronation of kings and queens, even\nmodern ones, a certain curious
    process of seasoning them for their\nfunctions is gone through. There is a saltcellar
    of state, so\ncalled, and there may be a castor of state. How they use the salt,\nprecisely-
    who knows? Certain I am, however, that a king's head is\nsolemnly oiled at his
    coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it\nbe, though, that they anoint it
    with a view of making its interior run\nwell, as they anoint machinery? Much
    might be ruminated here,\nconcerning the essential dignity of this regal process,
    because in\ncommon life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints\nhis
    hair, and palpably smells of that anointing. In truth, a mature\nman who uses
    hairoil, unless medicinally, that man has probably got\na quoggy spot in him
    somewhere. As a general rule, he can't amount\nto much in his totality.\n  But
    the only thing to be considered here is this- what kind of oil\nis used at coronations?
    Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar\noil, nor castor oil, nor bear's
    oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil.\nWhat then can it possibly be, but the
    sperm oil in its unmanufactured,\nunpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?\n 
    Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and\nqueens with
    coronation stuff!\n  "
