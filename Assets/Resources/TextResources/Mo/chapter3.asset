  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 4,   The Counterpane
  content: "\n  Call me Ishmael. Some years ago- never mind how long precisely-\nhaving
    little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to\ninterest me on shore,
    I thought I would sail about a little and see\nthe watery part of the world.
    It is a way I have of driving off the\nspleen and regulating the circulation.
    Whenever I find myself\ngrowing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,
    drizzly\nNovember in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing\nbefore
    coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral\nI meet; and especially
    whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me,\nthat it requires a strong moral
    principle to prevent me from\ndeliberately stepping into the street, and methodically
    knocking\npeople's hats off- then, I account it high time to get to sea as\nsoon
    as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a\nphilosophical flourish
    Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly\ntake to the ship. There is nothing
    surprising in this. If they but\nknew it, almost all men in their degree, some
    time or other, cherish\nvery nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with
    me.\n  There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by\nwharves
    as Indian isles by coral reefs- commerce surrounds it with her\nsurf. Right and
    left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme\ndowntown is the battery, where
    that noble mole is washed by waves, and\ncooled by breezes, which a few hours
    previous were out of sight of\nland. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\n 
    Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from\nCorlears Hook
    to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall,\nnorthward. What do you see?-
    Posted like silent sentinels all around\nthe town, stand thousands upon thousands
    of mortal men fixed in\nocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some
    seated upon\nthe pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China;\nsome
    high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better\nseaward peep.
    But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath\nand plaster- tied to
    counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks.\nHow then is this? Are the green
    fields gone? What do they here?\n  But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight
    for the water,\nand seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content
    them but\nthe extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of\nyonder
    warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the\nwater as they
    possibly can without falling And there they stand- miles\nof them- leagues. Inlanders
    all, they come from lanes and alleys,\nstreets avenues- north, east, south, and
    west. Yet here they all\nunite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles
    of the\ncompasses of all those ships attract them thither?\n  Once more. Say
    you are in the country; in some high land of lakes.\nTake almost any path you
    please, and ten to one it carries you down in\na dale, and leaves you there by
    a pool in the stream. There is magic\nin it. Let the most absent-minded of men
    be plunged in his deepest\nreveries- stand that man on his legs, set his feet
    a-going, and he\nwill infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all
    that\nregion. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try\nthis
    experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a\nmetaphysical professor.
    Yes, as every one knows, meditation and\nwater are wedded for ever.\n  But here
    is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest,\nshadiest, quietest, most
    enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all\nthe valley of the Saco. What is
    the chief element he employs? There\nstand his trees, each with a hollow trunk,
    as if a hermit and a\ncrucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there
    sleep\nhis cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep\ninto
    distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs\nof mountains
    bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture\nlies thus tranced, and
    though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs\nlike leaves upon this shepherd's
    head, yet all were vain, unless the\nshepherd's eye were fixed upon the magic
    stream before him. Go visit\nthe Prairies in June, when for scores on scores
    of miles you wade\nknee-deep among Tiger-lilies- what is the one charm wanting?-
    Water-\nthere is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of\nsand,
    would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor\npoet of Tennessee,
    upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver,\ndeliberate whether to buy him
    a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest\nhis money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway
    Beach? Why is almost\nevery robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in
    him, at some\ntime or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as
    a\npassenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first\ntold
    that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the\nold Persians
    hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a\nseparate deity, and own brother
    of Jove? Surely all this is not\nwithout meaning. And still deeper the meaning
    of that story of\nNarcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild
    image\nhe saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same\nimage,
    we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of\nthe ungraspable
    phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.\n  Now, when I say that I am
    in the habit of going to sea whenever I\nbegin to grow hazy about the eyes, and
    begin to be over conscious of\nmy lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that
    I ever go to sea as a\npassenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have
    a purse, and a\npurse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides,\npassengers
    get sea-sick- grow quarrelsome- don't sleep of nights- do\nnot enjoy themselves
    much, as a general thing;- no, I never go as a\npassenger; nor, though I am something
    of a salt, do I ever go to sea\nas a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon
    the glory and\ndistinction of such offices to those who like them. For my part,
    I\nabominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of\nevery
    kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of\nmyself, without
    taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and\nwhat not. And as for going
    as cook,- though I confess there is\nconsiderable glory in that, a cook being
    a sort of officer on\nship-board- yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;-
    though once\nbroiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and\npeppered,
    there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say\nreverentially,
    of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the\nidolatrous dotings of the old
    Egyptians upon broiled ibis and\nroasted river horse, that you see the mummies
    of those creatures in\ntheir huge bakehouses the pyramids.\n  No, when I go to
    sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the\nmast, plumb down into the fore-castle,
    aloft there to the royal\nmast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and
    make me jump\nfrom spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first,\nthis
    sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one's sense of\nhonor, particularly
    if you come of an old established family in the\nland, the Van Rensselaers, or
    Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more\nthan all, if just previous to putting your
    hand into the tar-pot,\nyou have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making
    the tallest\nboys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure\nyou,
    from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong\ndecoction of Seneca and
    the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear\nit. But even this wears off in time.\n 
    What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a\nbroom and
    sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to,\nweighed, I mean, in
    the scales of the New Testament? Do you think\nthe archangel Gabriel thinks anything
    the less of me, because I\npromptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that
    particular\ninstance? Who ain't a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the
    old\nsea-captains may order me about- however they may thump and punch me\nabout,
    I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that\neverybody else
    is one way or other served in much the same way- either\nin a physical or metaphysical
    point of view, that is; and so the\nuniversal thump is passed round, and all
    hands should rub each other's\nshoulder-blades, and be content.\n  Again, I always
    go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point\nof paying me for my trouble,
    whereas they never pay passengers a\nsingle penny that I ever heard of. On the
    contrary, passengers\nthemselves must pay. And there is all the difference in
    the world\nbetween paying and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most\nuncomfortable
    infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon\nus. But being paid,- what
    will compare with it? The urbane activity\nwith which a man receives money is
    really marvellous, considering that\nwe so earnestly believe money to be the
    root of all earthly ills,\nand that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.
    Ah! how\ncheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!\n  Finally, I always go
    to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome\nexercise and pure air of the fore-castle
    deck. For as in this world,\nhead winds are far more prevalent than winds from
    astern (that is,\nif you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most
    part\nthe Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand\nfrom
    the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first;\nbut not so. In
    much the same way do the commonalty lead their\nleaders in many other things,
    at the same time that the leaders little\nsuspect it. But wherefore it was that
    after having repeatedly smelt\nthe sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take
    it into my head to\ngo on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer
    of the\nFates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs\nme,
    and influences me in some unaccountable way- he can better\nanswer than any one
    else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling\nvoyage, formed part of the grand
    programme of Providence that was\ndrawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort
    of brief interlude\nand solo between more extensive performances. I take it that
    this part\nof the bill must have run something like this:\n\n  \"Grand Contested
    Election for the Presidency of the United States.\n                 \"WHALING
    VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.\"\n                 \"BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.\"\n\n 
    Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers,\nthe Fates,
    put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage,\nwhen others were set down
    for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and\nshort and easy parts in genteel
    comedies, and jolly parts in farces-\nthough I cannot tell why this was exactly;
    yet, now that I recall\nall the circumstances, I think I can see a little into
    the springs and\nmotives which being cunningly presented to me under various
    disguises,\ninduced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling
    me\ninto the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own\nunbiased freewill
    and discriminating judgment.\n  Chief among these motives was the overwhelming
    idea of the great\nwhale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused
    all\nmy curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his\nisland
    bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these,\nwith all the attending
    marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and\nsounds, helped to sway me to my
    wish. With other men, perhaps, such\nthings would not have been inducements;
    but as for me, I am\ntormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I
    love to sail\nforbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what
    is\ngood, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social\nwith it-
    would they let me- since it is but well to be on friendly\nterms with all the
    inmates of the place one lodges in.\n  By reason of these things, then, the whaling
    voyage was welcome; the\ngreat flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and
    in the wild\nconceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated\ninto
    my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most\nof them all,
    one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.   "
