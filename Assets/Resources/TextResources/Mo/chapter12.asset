  content: "\n  Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm\nthrown
    over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had\nalmost thought I
    had been his wife. The counterpane was of\npatchwork, full of odd little parti-colored
    squares and triangles; and\nthis arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable
    Cretan\nlabyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise\nshade-
    owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in\nsun and shade,
    his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various\ntimes- this same arm of his,
    I say, looked for all the world like a\nstrip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed,
    partly lying on it as\nthe arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it
    from the quilt,\nthey so blended their hues together; and it was only by the
    sense of\nweight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.\n 
    My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a\nchild,
    I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;\nwhether it was
    a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle.\nThe circumstance was this.
    I had been cutting up some caper or\nother- I think it was trying to crawl up
    the chimney, as I had seen\na little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother
    who,\nsomehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed\nsupperless,-
    my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and\npacked me off to bed,
    though it was only two o'clock in the\nafternoon of the 21st June, the longest
    day in year in our hemisphere.\nI felt dreadfully. But there was no help for
    it, so up stairs I went\nto my little room in the third floor, undressed myself
    as slowly as\npossible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between
    the\nsheets.\n  I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must\nelapse
    before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed!\nthe small of my
    back ached to think of it. And it was so light too;\nthe sun shining in at the
    window, and a great rattling of coaches in\nthe streets, and the sound of gay
    voices all over the house. I felt\nworse and worse- at last I got up, dressed,
    and softly going down in\nmy stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly
    threw\nmyself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favor to give me\na
    good slippering for my misbehaviour: anything indeed but\ncondemning me to lie
    abed such an unendurable length of time. But\nshe was the best and most conscientious
    of stepmothers, and back I had\nto go to my room. For several hours I lay there
    broad awake, feeling a\ngreat deal worse than I have ever done since, even from
    the greatest\nsubsequent misfortunes. At last I must have fallen into a troubled\nnightmare
    of a doze; and slowly waking from it- half steeped in\ndreams- I opened my eyes,
    and the before sunlit room was now wrapped\nin outer darkness. Instantly I felt
    a shock running through all my\nframe; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was
    to be heard; but a\nsupernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung over
    the\ncounterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom,\nto
    which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side.\nFor what seemed
    ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the\nmost awful fears, not daring
    to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking\nthat if I could but stir it one single
    inch, the horrid spell would be\nbroken. I knew not how this consciousness at
    last glided away from me;\nbut waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered
    it all, and for\ndays and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding\nattempts
    to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I often\npuzzle myself with it.\n 
    Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\nsupernatural
    hand in mine were very similar, in the strangeness, to\nthose which I experienced
    on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan arm\nthrown round me. But at length
    all the past night's events soberly\nrecurred, one by one, in fixed reality,
    and then I lay only alive to\nthe comical predicament. For though I tried to
    move his arm- unlock\nhis bridegroom clasp- yet, sleeping as he was, he still
    hugged me\ntightly, as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove\nto
    rouse him- \"Queequeg!\"- but his only answer was a snore. I then\nrolled over,
    my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and\nsuddenly felt a slight
    scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane,\nthere lay the tomahawk sleeping by
    the savage's side, as if it were\na hatchet-faced baby. A pretty pickle, truly,
    thought I; abed here\nin a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and
    a tomahawk!\n\"Queequeg!- in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!\" At length,
    by\ndint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant expostulations upon the\nunbecomingness
    of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort\nof style, I succeeded
    in extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew\nback his arm, shook himself all
    over like a Newfoundland dog just from\nthe water, and sat up in bed, stiff as
    a pike-staff, looking at me,\nand rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether
    remember how I came\nto be there, though a dim consciousness of knowing something
    about\nme seemed slowly dawning over him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing\nhim,
    having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly\nobserving so curious
    a creature. When, at last, his mind seemed made\nup touching the character of
    his bedfellow, and he became, as it were,\nreconciled to the fact; he jumped
    out upon the floor, and by certain\nsigns and sounds gave me to understand that,
    if it pleased me, he\nwould dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards,
    leaving the\nwhole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg, under the\ncircumstances,
    this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is,\nthese savages have an
    innate sense of delicacy, say what you will;\nit is marvellous how essentially
    polite they are. I pay this\nparticular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated
    me with so\nmuch civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\nstaring
    at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions;\nfor the time my
    curiosity getting the better of my breeding.\nNevertheless, a man like Queequeg
    you don't see every day, he and\nhis ways were well worth unusual regarding.\n 
    He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very\ntall one, by
    the by, and then- still minus his trowsers-  he hunted up\nhis boots. What under
    the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but\nhis next movement was to crush
    himself- boots in hand, and hat on-\nunder the bed; when, from sundry violent
    gaspings and strainings, I\ninferred he was hard at work booting himself; though
    by no law of\npropriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private
    when\nputting on his boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in\nthe
    transition stage- neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just\nenough civilized
    to show off his outlandishness in the strangest\npossible manners. His education
    was not yet completed. He was an\nundergraduate. If he had not been a small degree
    civilized, he very\nprobably would not have troubled himself with boots at all;
    but\nthen, if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of\ngetting
    under the bed to put them on. At last, he emerged with his hat\nvery much dented
    and crushed down over his eyes, and began creaking\nand limping about the room,
    as if, not being much accustomed to boots,\nhis pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide
    ones- probably not made to order\neither- rather pinched and tormented him at
    the first go off of a\nbitter cold morning.\n  Seeing, now, that there were no
    curtains to the window, and that the\nstreet being very narrow, the house opposite
    commanded a plain view\ninto the room, and observing more and more the indecorous
    figure\nthat Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and\nboots
    on; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet\nsomewhat, and
    particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as\npossible. He complied, and
    then proceeded to wash himself. At that\ntime in the morning any Christian would
    have washed his face; but\nQueequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with
    restricting his\nablutions to his chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his
    waistcoat,\nand taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table,\ndipped
    it into water and commenced lathering his face. I was\nwatching to see where
    he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he\ntakes the harpoon from the bed corner,
    slips out the long wooden\nstock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his
    boot, and\nstriding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous\nscraping,
    or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this\nis using Rogers's
    best cutlery with a vengeance. Afterwards I wondered\nthe less at this operation
    when I came to know of what fine steel\nthe head of a harpoon is made, and how
    exceedingly sharp the long\nstraight edges are always kept.\n  The rest of his
    toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out\nof the room, wrapped up
    in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting\nhis harpoon like a marshal's
    baton.\n  "
