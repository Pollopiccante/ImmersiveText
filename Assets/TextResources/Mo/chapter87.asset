  content: "\n  Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now\nwent
    rolling through the bright Quito spring, which at sea, almost\nperpetually reigns
    on the threshold of the eternal August of the\nTropic. The warmly cool, clear,
    ringing perfumed, overflowing,\nredundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian
    sherbet, heaped up-\nflaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately
    nights seemed\nhaughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride,\nthe
    memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns!\nFor sleeping
    man, 'twas hard to choose between such winsome days and\nsuch seducing nights.
    But all the witcheries of that unwaning\nweather did not merely lend new spells
    and potencies to the outward\nworld. Inward they turned upon the soul, especially
    when the still\nmild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as
    the clear\nice most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these subtle\nagencies,
    more and more they wrought on Ahab's texture.\n  Old age is always wakeful; as
    if, the longer linked with life, the\nless man has to do with aught that looks
    like death. Among\nsea-commanders, the old greybeards will oftenest leave their
    berths to\nvisit the night-cloaked deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now,
    of\nlate, he seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly\nspeaking, his
    visits were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to\nthe planks. \"It feels
    like going down into one's tomb,\"- he would\nmutter to himself- \"for an old
    captain like me to be descending this\nnarrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug
    berth.\"\n  So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night\nwere
    set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band\nbelow; and when
    if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the\nsailors flung it not rudely
    down, as by day, but with some\ncautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of
    disturbing their\nslumbering shipmates; when this sort of steady quietude would
    begin to\nprevail, habitually, the silent steersman would watch the\ncabin-scuttle;
    and ere long the old man would emerge, gripping at\nthe iron banister, to help
    his crippled way. Some considering touch of\nhumanity was in him; for at times
    like these, he usually abstained\nfrom patrolling the quarter-deck; because to
    his wearied mates,\nseeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such
    would have\nbeen the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their\ndreams
    would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks. But once, the\nmood was on
    him too deep for common regardings; and as with heavy,\nlumber-like pace he was
    measuring the ship from taffrail to\nmainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came
    up from below, with a\ncertain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that
    if Captain\nAhab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay;
    but\nthere might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting something\nindistinctly
    and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the\ninsertion into it, of the ivory
    heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know\nAhab then.\n  \"Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,\"
    said Ahab, \"that thou wouldst wad me\nthat fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot.
    Below to thy nightly\ngrave; where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye
    to the\nfilling one at last.- Down, dog, and kennel!\"\n  Starting at the unforseen
    concluding exclamation of the so\nsuddenly scornful old man, Stubb was speechless
    a moment; then said\nexcitedly, \"I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir;
    I do but less\nthan half like it, sir.\"\n  \"Avast! gritted Ahab between his
    set teeth, and violently moving\naway, as if to avoid some passionate temptation.\n 
    \"No, sir; not yet,\" said Stubb, emboldened, \"I will not tamely be\ncalled
    a dog, sir.\"\n  \"Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass,
    and\nbegone, or I'll clear the world of thee!\"\n  As he said this, Ahab advanced
    upon him with such overbearing\nterrors in his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily
    retreated.\n  \"I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,\"\nmuttered
    Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle.\n\"It's very queer.
    Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don't well know whether\nto go back and strike him,
    or- what's that?- down here on my knees and\npray for him? Yes, that was the
    thought coming up in me; but it\nwould be the first time I ever did pray. It's
    queer; very queer; and\nhe's queer too; aye, take him fore and aft, he's about
    the queerest\nold man Stubb ever sailed with. How he flashed at me!- his eyes
    like\npowder-pans! is he mad! Anyway there's something's on his mind, as\nsure
    as there must be something on a deck when it cracks. He aint in\nhis bed now,
    either, more than three hours out of the twenty-four; and\nhe don't sleep then.
    Didn't that Dough-Boy, the steward, tell me\nthat of a morning he always finds
    the old man's hammock clothes all\nrumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at
    the foot, and the coverlid\nalmost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of
    frightful hot, as\nthough a baked brick had been on it? A hot old man! I guess
    he's got\nwhat some folks ashore call a conscience; it's a kind of Tic-Dolly-row\nthey
    say- worse nor a toothache. Well, well; I don't know what it\nis, but the Lord
    keep me from catching it. He's full of riddles; I\nwonder what he goes into the
    after hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy\ntells me he suspects; what's that
    for, I should like to know? Who's\nmade appointments with him in the hold? Ain't
    that queer, now? But\nthere's no telling, it's the old game- Here goes for a
    snooze. Damn\nme, it's worth a fellow's while to be born into the world, if only\nto
    fall right asleep. And now that I think of it, that's about the\nfirst thing
    babies do, and that's a sort of queer, too. Damn me, but\nall things are queer,
    come to think of 'em. But that's against my\nprinciples. Think not, is my eleventh
    commandment; and sleep when\nyou can, is my twelfth- So here goes again. But
    how's that? didn't\nhe call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times a donkey,
    and piled a\nlot of jackasses on top of that! He might as well have kicked me,\nand
    done with me. Maybe he did kick me, and I didn't observe it, I was\nso taken
    aback with his brow, somehow. It flashed like a bleached\nbone. What the devil's
    the matter with me? I don't stand right on my\nlegs. Coming afoul of that old
    man has a sort of turned me wrong\nside out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming,
    though- How? how?\nhow?- but the only way's to stash it; so here goes to hammock
    again;\nand in the morning, I'll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over\nby
    daylight.\"\n  "
