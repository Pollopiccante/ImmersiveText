  content: "\n  (Stubb solus, and mending a brace.)\n\n  Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear
    my throat!- I've been thinking over it\never since, and that ha, ha's the final
    consequence. Why so? Because a\nlaugh's the wisest, easiest answer to all that's
    queer; and come\nwhat will, one comfort's always left- that unfailing comfort
    is,\nit's all predestinated. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to\nmy
    poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening\nfelt. Be sure
    the old Mogul has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it;\nhad the gift, might
    readily have prophesied it- for when I clapped\nmy eye upon his skull I saw it.
    Well, Stubb, wise Stubb- that's my\ntitle- well, Stubb, what of it, Stubb? Here's
    a carcase. I know not\nall that may be coming, but be it what it will, I'll go
    to it\nlaughing. Such a waggish leering as lurks in all your horribles! I\nfeel
    funny. Fa, la! lirra, skirra! What's my juicy little pear at home\ndoing now?
    Crying its eyes out?- Giving a party to the last arrived\nharpooneers, I dare
    say, gay as a frigate's pennant, and so am I-\nfa, la! lirra, skirra! Oh-\n\n        
    We'll drink to-night with hearts as light,\n           To love, as gay and fleeting\n        
    As bubbles that swim, on the beaker's brim,\n           And break on the lips
    while meeting.\n\n  A brave stave that- who calls? Mr. Starbuck? Aye, aye, sir-\n(Aside)
    he's my superior, he has his too, if I'm not mistaken.- Aye,\naye, sir, just
    through with this job- coming.\n  "
