  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 52,   The Albatross
  content: "\n  As Queequeg's Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue\nall
    day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall;\nfor I cherish
    the greatest respect towards everybody's religious\nobligations, never mind how
    comical, and could not find it in my heart\nto undervalue even a congregation
    of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or\nthose other creatures in certain parts
    of our earth, who with a degree\nof footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets,
    bow down before\nthe torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account
    of the\ninordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name.\n  I say, we
    good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these\nthings, and not fancy
    ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,\npagans and what not, because
    of their half-crazy conceits on these\nsubjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly
    entertaining the most\nabsurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;- but what of
    that? Queequeg\nthought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be
    content;\nand there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail;\nlet
    him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all- Presbyterians\nand Pagans alike-
    for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about\nthe head, and sadly need mending.\n 
    Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and\nrituals must
    be over, I went to his room and knocked at the door;\nbut no answer. I tried
    to open it, but it was fastened inside.\n\"Queequeg,\" said I softly through
    the key-hole:- all silent. \"I say,\nQueequeg! why don't you speak? It's I- Ishmael.\"
    But all remained\nstill as before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him
    such\nabundant time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked\nthrough
    the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the\nroom, the key-hole
    prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I\ncould only see part of the foot-board
    of the bed and a line of the\nwall, but nothing more. I was surprised to behold
    resting against\nthe wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg's harpoon, which the landlady\nthe
    evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting to the\nchamber. That's
    strange, thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon\nstands yonder, and he
    seldom or never goes abroad without it,\ntherefore he must be inside here, and
    no possible mistake.\n  \"Queequeg!- Queequeg!\"- all still. Something must have
    happened.\nApoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly\nresisted.
    Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the\nfirst person I met-
    the chamber-maid. \"La! la!\" she cried, \"I\nthought something must the matter.
    I went to make the bed after\nbreakfast, and the door was locked; and not a mouse
    to be heard; and\nit's been just so silent ever since. But I thought, may be,
    you had\nboth gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping. La! la,\nma'am!-
    Mistress! murder! Mrs. Hussey! apoplexy!\"- and with these\ncries she ran towards
    the kitchen, I following.\n  Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in
    one hand and a\nvinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the\noccupation
    of attending to the castors, and scolding her little\nblack boy meantime.\n 
    \"Wood-house!\" cried I, \"which way to it? Run for God's sake, and\nfetch something
    to pry open the door- the axe!- the axe! he's had a\nstroke; depend upon it!\"-
    and so saying I was unmethodically rushing\nup stairs again empty-handed, when
    Mrs. Hussey interposed the\nmustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor
    of her\ncountenance.\n  \"What's the matter with you, young man?\"\n  \"Get the
    axe! For God's sake, run for the doctor, some one, while\nI pry it open!\"\n 
    \"Look here,\" said the landlady, quickly putting down the\nvinegar-cruet, so
    as to have one hand free; \"look here; are you\ntalking about prying open any
    of my doors?\"- and with that she\nseized my arm. \"What's the matter with you?
    What's the matter with\nyou, shipmate?\"\n  In as calm, but rapid a manner as
    possible, I gave her to understand\nthe whole case. Unconsciously clapping the
    vinegar-cruet to one side\nof her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed-
    \"No! I\nhaven't seen it since I put it there.\" Running to a little closet\nunder
    the landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told\nme that Queequeg's
    harpoon was missing. \"He's killed himself,\" she\ncried. \"It's unfort'nate
    Stiggs done over again there goes another\ncounterpane- God pity his poor mother!-
    it will be the ruin of my\nhouse. Has the poor lad a sister? Where's that girl?-
    there, Betty, go\nto Snarles the Painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, with-
    \"no\nsuicides permitted here, and no smoking in the parlor;\"- might as well\nkill
    both birds at once. Kill? The Lord be merciful to his ghost!\nWhat's that noise
    there? You, young man, avast there!\"\n  And running after me, she caught me
    as I was again trying to force\nopen the door.\n  \"I won't allow it; I won't
    have my premises spoiled. Go for the\nlocksmith, there's one about a mile from
    here. But avast!\" putting her\nhand in her side pocket, \"here's a key that'll
    fit, I guess; let's\nsee.\" And with that, she turned it in the lock; but alas!
    Queequeg's\nsupplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.\n  \"Have to burst
    it open,\" said I, and was running down the entry a\nlittle, for a good start,
    when the landlady caught at me, again vowing\nI should not break down her premises;
    but I tore from her, and with\na sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against
    the mark.\n  With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming\nagainst
    the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good\nheavens! there sat
    Queequeg, altogether cool on his hams, and\nholding Yojo on top of his head.
    He looked neither one way nor the\nother way but sat like a carved image with
    scarce a sign of active\nlife.\n  \"Queequeg,\" said I, going up to him, \"Queequeg,
    what's the matter\nwith you?\"\n  \"He hain't been a sittin' so all day, has
    he?\" said the landlady.\n  But all we said, not a word could we drag out of
    him; I almost\nfelt like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for
    it was\nalmost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally\nconstrained;
    especially, as in all probability he had been sitting\nso for upwards of eight
    or ten hours, going too without his regular\nmeals.\n  \"Mrs. Hussey,\" said
    I, \"he's alive at all events; so leave us, if\nyou please, and I will see to
    this strange affair myself.\"\n  Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored
    to prevail upon\nQueequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all
    he\ncould do- for all my polite arts and blandishments- he would not\nmove a
    peg, nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice\nmy presence in the
    slightest way.\n  I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his\nRamadan;
    do they fast on their hams that way in his native land. It\nmust be so; yes,
    it's a part of his creed, I suppose; well, then,\nlet him rest; he'll get up
    sooner or later, no doubt. It can't last\nfor ever, thank God, and his Ramadan
    only comes once a year; and I\ndon't believe it's very punctual then.\n  I went
    down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the\nlong stories of some
    sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding\nvoyage, as they called it (that
    is, a short whaling-voyage in a\nschooner or brig, confined to the north of the
    line, in the Atlantic\nOcean only); after listening to these plum-puddingers
    till nearly\neleven o'clock, I went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure
    by\nthis time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a\ntermination.
    But no; there he was just where I had left him; he had\nnot stirred an inch.
    I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so\ndownright senseless and insane
    to be sitting there all day and half\nthe night on his hams in a cold room, holding
    a piece of wood on his\nhead.\n  \"For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake
    yourself; get up\nand have some supper. You'll starve; you'll kill yourself,\nQueequeg.\"
    But not a word did he reply.\n  Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to
    go to bed and to\nsleep; and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow
    me. But\nprevious to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw\nit
    over him, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had\nnothing but his
    ordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I\nwould, I could not get into
    the faintest doze. I had blown out the\ncandle; and the mere thought of Queequeg-
    not four feet off- sitting\nthere in that uneasy position, stark alone in the
    cold and dark;\nthis made me really wretched. Think of it; sleeping all night
    in the\nsame room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary,\nunaccountable
    Ramadan!\n  But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till\nbreak
    of day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg,\nas if he had
    been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the\nfirst glimpse of sun entered
    the window, up he got, with stiff grating\njoints, but with a cheerful look;
    limped towards me where I lay;\npressed his forehead again against mine; and
    said his Ramadan was\nover.\n  Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to
    any person's\nreligion, be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill
    or\ninsult any other person, because that other person don't believe it\nalso.
    But when a man's religion becomes really frantic; when it is a\npositive torment
    to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an\nuncomfortable inn to lodge
    in; then I think it high time to take\nthat individual aside and argue the point
    with him.\n  And just so I now did with Queequeg. \"Queequeg,\" said I, \"get
    into\nbed now, and lie and listen to me.\" I then went on, beginning with the\nrise
    and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the\nvarious religions
    of the present time, during which time I labored\nto show Queequeg that all these
    Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged\nham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were
    stark nonsense; bad for\nthe health; useless for the soul; opposed, in short,
    to the obvious\nlaws of Hygiene and common sense. I told him, too, that he being
    in\nother things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it\npained
    me, very badly pained me, to see him now so deplorably\nfoolish about this ridiculous
    Ramadan of his. Besides, argued I,\nfasting makes the body cave in; hence the
    spirit caves in; and all\nthoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved.
    This is\nthe reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy\nnotions
    about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg, said I,\nrather digressively;
    hell is an idea first born on an undigested\napple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated
    through the hereditary\ndyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\n  I then asked Queequeg
    whether he himself was ever troubled with\ndyspepsia; expressing the idea very
    plainly, so that he could take\nit in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion.
    It was after a\ngreat feast given by his father the king on the gaining of a
    great\nbattle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o'clock\nin
    the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.\n  \"No more, Queequeg,\"
    said I, shuddering; \"that will do;\" for I\nknew the inferences without his
    further hinting them. I had seen a\nsailor who had visited that very island,
    and he told me that it was\nthe custom, when a great battle had been gained there,
    to barbecue all\nthe slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one
    by one,\nthey were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like
    a\npilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their\nmouths,
    were sent round with the victor's compliments to all his\nfriends, just as though
    these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.\n  After all, I do not think that
    my remarks about religion made much\nimpression upon Queequeg. Because, in the
    first place, he somehow\nseemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless
    considered\nfrom his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not\nmore
    than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would;\nand, finally,
    he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the\ntrue religion than I
    did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending\nconcern and compassion, as
    though he thought it a great pity that such\na sensible young man should be so
    hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan\npiety.\n  At last we rose and dressed;
    and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously\nhearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts,
    so that the landlady should\nnot make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we
    sallied out to board\nthe Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with
    halibut\nbones.\n  "
