  content: "\n  Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so,\nafter
    a fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.\n  Nantucket! Take out your map and
    look at it. See what a real\ncorner of the world it occupies; how it stands there,
    away off\nshore, more lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it- a mere\nhillock,
    and elbow of sand; all beach, without a background. There\nis more sand there
    than you would use in twenty years as a\nsubstitute for blotting paper. Some
    gamesome wights will tell you that\nthey have to plant weeds there, they don't
    grow naturally; that they\nimport Canada thistles; that they have to send beyond
    seas for a spile\nto stop a leak in an oil cask; that pieces of wood in Nantucket
    are\ncarried about like bits of the true cross in Rome; that people there\nplant
    toadstools before their houses, to get under the shade in summer\ntime; that
    one blade of grass makes an oasis, three blades in a\nday's walk a prairie; that
    they wear quicksand shoes, something like\nLaplander snow-shoes; that they are
    so shut up, belted about, every\nway inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter
    island of by the ocean,\nthat to the very chairs and tables small clams will
    sometimes be found\nadhering as to the backs of sea turtles. But these extravaganzas\nonly
    show that Nantucket is no Illinois.\n  Look now at the wondrous traditional story
    of how this island was\nsettled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden
    times an\neagle swooped down upon the New England coast and carried off an\ninfant
    Indian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their\nchild borne out
    of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow\nin the same direction.
    Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous\npassage they discovered the island,
    and there they found an empty\nivory casket,- the poor little Indian's skeleton.\n 
    What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach,\nshould take to
    the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and\nquahogs in the sand; grown
    bolder, they waded out with nets for\nmackerel; more experienced, they pushed
    off in boats and captured cod;\nand at last, launching a navy of great ships
    on the sea, explored this\nwatery world; put an incessant belt of circumnavigations
    round it;\npeeped in at Behring's Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans\ndeclared
    everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has\nsurvived the flood;
    most monstrous and most mountainous! That\nHimmalehan, salt-sea, Mastodon, clothed
    with such portentousness of\nunconscious power, that his very panics are more
    to be dreaded than\nhis most fearless and malicious assaults!\n  And thus have
    these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing\nfrom their ant-hill in
    the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world\nlike so many Alexanders; parcelling
    out among them the Atlantic,\nPacific, and Indian oceans, as the three pirate
    powers did Poland. Let\nAmerica add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada;
    let the\nEnglish overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing banner from\nthe
    sun; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer's.\nFor the sea
    is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other\nseamen having but a right
    of way through it. Merchant ships are but\nextension bridges; armed ones but
    floating forts; even pirates and\nprivateers, though following the sea as highwaymen
    the road. they\nbut plunder other ships, other fragments of the land like\nthemselves,
    without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless\ndeep itself. The Nantucketer,
    he alone resides and riots on the sea;\nhe alone, in Bible language, goes down
    to it in ships; to and fro\nploughing it as his own special plantation. There
    is his home; there\nlies his business which a Noah's flood would not interrupt,
    though\nit overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as\nprairie
    cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them\nas chamois hunters
    climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so\nthat when he comes to it
    at last, it smells like another world, more\nstrangely than the moon would to
    an Earthsman. With the landless gull,\nthat at sunset folds her wings and is
    rocked to sleep between billows;\nso at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight
    of land, furls his\nsails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow
    rush\nherds of walruses and whales.\n  "
