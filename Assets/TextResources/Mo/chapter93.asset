  content: "\n  Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.\n  \"Such a queer dream, King-Post,
    I never had. You know the old\nman's ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with
    it; and when I tried\nto kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my
    leg right\noff! And then, presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I like a blazing\nfool,
    kept kicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flask-\nyou know how curious
    all dreams are- through all this rage that I\nwas in, I somehow seemed to be
    thinking to myself, that after all,\nit was not much of an insult, that kick
    from Ahab. 'Why,' thinks I,\n'what's the row? It's not a real leg, only a false
    one.' And there's a\nmighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump.
    That's what\nmakes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear\nthan
    a blow from a cane. The living member- that makes the living\ninsult, my little
    man. And thinks I to myself all the while, mind,\nwhile I was stubbing my silly
    toes against that cursed pyramid- so\nconfoundedly contradictory was it all,
    all the while, I say, I was\nthinking to myself, 'what's his leg now, but a cane-.
    a whale-bone\ncane. Yes,' thinks I, 'it was only a playful cudgelling- in fact,
    only\na whaleboning that he gave me- not a base kick. Besides,' thinks I,\n'look
    at it once; why, the end of it- the foot part- what a small sort\nof end it is;
    whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me, there's a\ndevilish broad insult.
    But this insult is whittled down to a point\nonly.' But now comes the greatest
    joke of the dream, Flask. While I\nwas battering away at the pyramid, a sort
    of badger-haired old merman,\nwith a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders,
    and slews me\nround. 'What are you 'bout?' says he. Slid! man, but I was frightened.\nSuch
    a phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was over the fright. 'What am\nI about?'
    says I at last. 'And what business is that of yours, I\nshould like to know,
    Mr. Humpback? Do you want a kick?' By the lord,\nFlask, I had no sooner said
    that, than he turned round his stern to\nme, bent over, and dragging up a lot
    of seaweed he had for a clout-\nwhat do you think, I saw?- why thunder alive,
    man, his stern was stuck\nfull of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I on
    second thought,\n'I guess I won't kick you, old fellow.' 'Wise Stubb,' said he,
    'wise\nStubb;' and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his\ngums
    like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn't going to stop saying over\nhis 'wise Stubb,
    wise Stubb,' I thought I might as well fall to\nkicking the pyramid again. But
    I had only just lifted my foot for\nit, when he roared out, 'Stop that kicking!'
    'Halloa,' says I, 'what's\nthe matter now, old fellow?' 'Look ye here,' says
    he; 'let's argue the\ninsult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn't he?' 'Yes, he did,'
    says I-\n'right here it was.' 'Very good,' says he- 'he used his ivory leg,\ndidn't
    he?' 'Yes, he did,' says I. 'Well then,' says he, 'wise\nStubb, what have you
    to complain of? Didn't he kick with right good\nwill? it wasn't a common pitch
    pine leg he kicked with, was it? No,\nyou were kicked by a great man, and with
    a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.\nIt's an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen,
    wise Stubb. In old\nEngland the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped
    by a\nqueen, and made garter-knights of; but, be your boast, Stubb, that\nye
    were kicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I\nsay; be kicked
    by him; account his kicks honors; and on no account\nkick back; for you can't
    help yourself, wise Stubb. Don't you see that\npyramid?' With that, he all of
    a sudden seemed somehow, in some\nqueer fashion, to swim off into the air. I
    snored; rolled over; and\nthere I was in my hammock! Now, what do you think of
    that dream,\nFlask?\"\n  \"I don't know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.'\"\n 
    \"May be; may be. But it's made a wise man of me, Flask. D'ye see\nAhab standing
    there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best\nthing you can do, Flask,
    is to let the old man alone; never speak to\nhim, whatever he says. Halloa! What's
    that he shouts? Hark!\"\n  \"Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are
    whales\nhereabouts!\n  If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!\n  \"What
    do you think of that now, Flask? ain't there a small drop of\nsomething queer
    about that, eh? A white whale- did ye mark that,\nman? Look ye- there's something
    special in the wind. Stand by for\nit, Flask. Ahab has that that's bloody on
    his mind. But, mum; he comes\nthis way.\"\n  "
