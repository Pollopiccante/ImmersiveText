  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 34,   The Cabin-Table
  content: "\n  We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals,\nand
    Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed\nlegs over mine,
    and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and\nfree and easy were we;
    when, at last, by reason of our confabulations,\nwhat little nappishness remained
    in us altogether departed, and we\nfelt like getting up again, though day-break
    was yet some way down the\nfuture.\n  Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so
    that our recumbent\nposition began to grow wearisome, and by little and little
    we found\nourselves sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning\nagainst
    the headboard with our four knees drawn up close together, and\nour two noses
    bending over them, as if our knee-pans were\nwarming-pans. We felt very nice
    and snug, the more so since it was\nso chilly out of doors; indeed out of bed-clothes
    too, seeing that\nthere was no fire in the room. The more so, I say, because
    truly to\nenjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there
    is\nno quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast.\nNothing
    exists in itself. If you flatter yourself that you are all\nover comfortable,
    and have been so a long time, then you cannot be\nsaid to be comfortable any
    more. But if, like Queequeg and me in the\nbed, the tip of your nose or the crown
    of your head be slightly\nchilled, why then, indeed, in the general consciousness
    you feel\nmost delightfully and unmistakably warm. For this reason a sleeping\napartment
    should never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the\nluxurious discomforts
    of the rich. For the height of this sort of\ndeliciousness is to have nothing
    but the blankets between you and your\nsnugness and the cold of the outer air.
    Then there you lie like the\none warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.\n 
    We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all\nat once
    I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets,\nwhether by day or by
    night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a\nway of always keeping my eyes shut,
    in order the more to concentrate\nthe snugness of being in bed. Because no man
    can ever feel his own\nidentity aright except his eyes be closed; as if, darkness
    were indeed\nthe proper element of our essences, though light be more congenial\nto
    our clayey part. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my\nown pleasant
    and self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse\nouter gloom of the unilluminated
    twelve-o'clock-at-night, I\nexperienced a disagreeable revulsion. Nor did I at
    all object to the\nhint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light,
    seeing\nthat we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a strong desire to\nhave
    a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be it said, that though I\nhad felt such
    a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the\nnight before, yet see how
    elastic our stiff prejudices grow when\nonce love comes to bend them. For now
    I liked nothing better than to\nhave Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because
    he seemed to be full\nof such serene household joy then. I no more felt unduly
    concerned for\nthe landlord's policy of insurance. I was only alive to the\ncondensed
    confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket\nwith a real friend.
    With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders,\nwe now passed the Tomahawk
    from one to the other, till slowly there\ngrew over us a blue hanging tester
    of smoke, illuminated by the\nflame of the new-lit lamp.\n  Whether it was that
    this undulating tester rolled the savage away to\nfar distant scenes, I know
    not, but he now spoke of his native island;\nand, eager to hear his history,
    I begged him to go on and tell it.\nHe gladly complied. Though at the time I
    but ill comprehended not a\nfew of his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when
    I had become more\nfamiliar with his broken phraseology, now enable me to present
    the\nwhole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.\n  "
