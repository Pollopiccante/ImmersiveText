  content: "\n  Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be\nlost
    in its unshored harborless immensities. Ere that come to pass;\nere the Pequod's
    weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled\nhulls of the leviathan; at
    the outset it is but well to attend to a\nmatter almost indispensable to a thorough
    appreciative understanding\nof the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions
    of all sorts\nwhich are to follow.\n  It is some systematized exhibition of the
    whale in his broad genera,\nthat I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no
    easy task. The\nclassification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is
    here\nessayed. Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid\ndown.\n 
    \"No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is\nentitled Cetology,\"
    says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.\n  \"It is not my intention, were it in my
    power, to enter into the\ninquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea
    into groups\nand families.... Utter confusion exists among the historians of
    this\nanimal\" (sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.\n  \"Unfitness to
    pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.\"\n\"Impenetrable veil covering
    our knowledge of the cetacea.\" \"A field\nstrewn with thorns.\" \"All these
    incomplete indications but serve to\ntorture us naturalists.\"\n  Thus speak
    of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and\nLesson, those lights of
    zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of\nreal knowledge there be little,
    yet of books there are a plenty; and\nso in some small degree, with cetology,
    or the science of whales. Many\nare the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen
    and seamen, who\nhave at large or in little, written of the whale. Run over a
    few:- The\nAuthors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne;\nGesner;
    Ray; Linnaeus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi;\nSibbald; Brisson; Marten;
    Lacepede; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron\nCuvier; Frederick Cuvier; John Hunter;
    Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett;\nJ. Ross Browne; the Author of Miriam Coffin;
    Olmstead; and the Rev. T.\nCheever. But to what ultimate generalizing purpose
    all these have\nwritten, the above cited extracts will show.\n  Of the names
    in this list of whale authors only those following Owen\never saw living whales;
    and but one of them was a real professional\nharpooneer and whaleman. I mean
    Captain Scoresby. On the separate\nsubject of the Greenland or right-whale, he
    is the best existing\nauthority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of
    the great\nsperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost\nunworthy
    mentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale\nis an usurper upon
    the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means\nthe largest of the whales.
    Yet, owing to the long priority of his\nclaims, and the profound ignorance which
    till some seventy years back,\ninvested the then fabulous or utterly unknown
    sperm-whale, and which\nignorance to this present day still reigns in all but
    some few\nscientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every\nway
    complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the\ngreat poets
    of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale,\nwithout one rival,
    was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time\nhas at last come for a new
    proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear\nye! good people all,- the Greenland
    whale is deposed,- the great sperm\nwhale now reigneth!\n  There are only two
    books in being which at all pretend to put the\nliving sperm whale before you,
    and at the same time, in the remotest\ndegree succeed in the attempt. Those books
    are Beale's and\nBennett's; both in their time surgeons to the English South-Sea\nwhale-ships,
    and both exact and reliable men. The original matter\ntouching the sperm whale
    to be found in their volumes is necessarily\nsmall; but so far as it goes, it
    is of excellent quality, though\nmostly confined to scientific description. As
    yet, however, the\nsperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any\nliterature.
    Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten\nlife.\n  Now the various
    species of whales need some sort of popular\ncomprehensive classification, if
    only an easy outline one for the\npresent, hereafter to be filled in all-outward
    its departments by\nsubsequent laborers. As no better man advances to take this
    matter\nin hand, I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing\ncomplete;
    because any human thing supposed to be complete must for\nthat very reason infallibly
    be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute\nanatomical description of the various
    species, or- in this space at\nleast- to much of any description. My object here
    is simply to project\nthe draught of a systematization of cetology. I am the
    architect,\nnot the builder.\n  But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter
    in the\nPost-Office is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea\nafter
    them; to have one's hands among the unspeakable foundations,\nribs, and very
    pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I\nthat I should essay
    to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful\ntauntings in Job might well appal
    me. \"Will he (the leviathan) make\na covenant with thee? Behold the hope of
    him is vain! But I have\nswam through libraries and sailed through oceans; I
    have had to do\nwith whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I
    will try.\nThere are some preliminaries to settle.\n  First: The uncertain, unsettled
    condition of this science of\nCetology is in the very vestibule attested by the
    fact, that in some\nquarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be
    a fish. In\nhis System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, \"I hereby separate\nthe
    whales from the fish.\" But of my own knowledge, I know that down\nto the year
    1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against\nLinnaeus's express edict,
    were still found dividing the possession\nof the same seas with the Leviathan.\n 
    The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the\nwhales from the
    waters, he states as follows: \"On account of their\nwarm bilocular heart, their
    lungs, their moveable eyelids, their\nhollow ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis
    lactantem,\" and finally,\n\"ex lege naturae jure meritoque.\" I submitted all
    this to my friends\nSimeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates
    of\nmine in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the\nreasons
    set forth were altogether insufficient. Charley profanely\nhinted they were humbug.\n 
    Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old\nfashioned ground
    that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to\nback me. This fundamental
    thing settled, the next point is, in what\ninternal respect does the whale differ
    from other fish. Above,\nLinnaeus has given you those items. But in brief they
    are these: lungs\nand warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold
    blooded.\n  Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so
    as\nconspicuously to label him for all time to come. To be short, then,\na whale
    is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail. There you have him.\nHowever contracted,
    that definition is the result of expanded\nmeditation. A walrus spouts much like
    a whale, but the walrus is not a\nfish, because he is amphibious. But the last
    term of the definition is\nstill more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost
    any one must have\nnoticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a
    flat, but\na vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the\ntail,
    though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a\nhorizontal position.\n 
    By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\nfrom the
    leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto\nidentified with the whale
    by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on\nthe other hand, link with it any
    fish hitherto authoritatively\nregarded as alien.* Hence, all the smaller, spouting
    and horizontal\ntailed fish must be included in this ground-plan of cetology.
    Now,\nthen, come the grand divisions of the entire whale host.\n\n  *I am aware
    that down to the present time, the fish styled\nLamatins and Dugongs (Pig-fish
    and Sow-fish of the Coffins of\nNantucket) are included by many naturalists among
    the whales. But as\nthese pig-fish are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking
    in the\nmouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do\nnot
    spout, I deny their credentials as whales; and have presented them\nwith their
    passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.\n\n  First: According to magnitude
    I divide the whales into three primary\nBOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and
    these shall comprehend them\nall, both small and large.\n  I. THE FOLIO WHALE;
    II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.\n  As the type of the FOLIO I
    present the Sperm Whale; of the OCTAVO,\nthe Grampus; of the DUODECIMO, the Porpoise.\n 
    FOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:- I. The\nSperm Whale;
    II. the Right Whale; III. the Fin Back Whale; IV. the\nHumpbacked Whale; V. the
    Razor Back Whale; VI. the Sulphur Bottom\nWhale.\n  BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER
    I. (Sperm Whale).- This whale, among the\nEnglish of old vaguely known as the
    Trumpa whale and the Physeter\nwhale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present
    Cachalot of the\nFrench, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus
    of the\nLong Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe;\nthe
    most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in\naspect; and
    lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the\nonly creature from
    which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is\nobtained. All his peculiarities
    will, in many other places, be\nenlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name that
    I now have to do.\nPhilologically considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago,
    when\nthe sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper\nindividuality,
    and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from\nthe stranded fish; in those
    days spermaceti, it would seem, was\npopularly supposed to be derived from a
    creature identical with the\none then known in England as the Greenland or Right
    Whale. It was\nthe idea also, that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor\nof
    the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word\nliterally expresses.
    In those times, also, spermaceti was\nexceedingly scarce, not being used for
    light, but only as an\nointment and medicament. It was only to be had from the
    druggists as\nyou nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the\ncourse
    of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its\noriginal name was still
    retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance\nits value by a notion so strangely
    significant of its scarcity. And so\nthe appellation must at last have come to
    be bestowed upon the whale\nfrom which this spermaceti was really derived.\n 
    BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER II. (Right Whale).- In one respect this\nis the most
    venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly\nhunted by man. It
    yields the article commonly known as whalebone or\nbaleen; and the oil specially
    known as \"whale oil,\" an inferior\narticle in commerce. Among the fishermen,
    he is indiscriminately\ndesignated by all the following titles: The Whale; the
    Greenland\nWhale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right\nWhale.
    There is a deal of obscurity concerning the Identity of the\nspecies thus multitudinously
    baptized. What then is the whale, which I\ninclude in the second species of my
    Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus\nof the English naturalists; the Greenland
    Whale of the English\nwhaleman; the Baliene Ordinaire of the French whalemen;
    the\nGrowlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for more than\ntwo
    centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the\nArctic seas;
    it is the whale which the American fishermen have long\npursued in the Indian
    ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor' West\nCoast, and various other parts
    of the world, designated by them\nRight Whale Cruising Grounds.\n  Some pretend
    to see a difference between the Greenland whale of\nthe English and the right
    whale of the Americans. But they precisely\nagree in all their grand features;
    nor has there yet been presented\na single determinate fact upon which to ground
    a radical\ndistinction. It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most\ninconclusive
    differences, that some departments of natural history\nbecome so repellingly
    intricate. The right whale will be elsewhere\ntreated of at some length, with
    reference to elucidating the sperm\nwhale.\n  BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER III. (Fin-Back).-
    Under this head I\nreckon a monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back,\nTall-Spout,
    and Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is\ncommonly the whale whose
    distant jet is so often descried by\npassengers crossing the Atlantic, in the
    New York packet-tracks. In\nthe length he attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back
    resembles the\nright whale, but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter color,\napproaching
    to olive. His great lips present a cable-like aspect,\nformed by the intertwisting,
    slanting folds of large wrinkles. His\ngrand distinguishing feature, the fin,
    from which he derives his name,\nis often a conspicuous object. This fin is some
    three or four feet\nlong, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back,
    of an\nangular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if not the\nslightest
    other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin\nwill, at times, be
    seen plainly projecting from the surface. When\nthe sea is moderately calm, and
    slightly marked with spherical\nripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and
    casts shadows upon the\nwrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery
    circle\nsurrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy\nhour-lines
    graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back.\nThe Fin-Back is
    not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some men\nare man-haters. Very shy;
    always going solitary; unexpectedly rising\nto the surface in the remotest and
    most sullen waters; his straight\nand single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic
    spear upon a\nbarren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in\nswimming,
    as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan\nseems the banished and
    unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his\nmark that style upon his back.
    From having the baleen in his mouth,\nthe Fin-Back is sometimes included with
    the right whale, among a\ntheoretic species denominated Whalebone whales, that
    is, whales with\nbaleen. Of these so-called Whalebone whales, there would seem
    to be\nseveral varieties, most of which, however, are little known.\nBroad-nosed
    whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched\nwhales; under-jawed whales
    and rostrated whales, are the fisherman's\nnames for a few sorts.\n  In connexion
    with this appellative of \"Whalebone whales,\" it is of\ngreat importance to
    mention, that however such a nomenclature may be\nconvenient in facilitating
    allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is\nin vain to attempt a clear classification
    of the Leviathan, founded\nupon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth;
    notwithstanding\nthat those marked parts or features very obviously seem better
    adapted\nto afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other\ndetached
    bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents.\nHow then? The
    baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things\nwhose peculiarities are
    indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts\nof whales, without any record to
    what may be the nature of their\nstructure in other and more essential particulars.
    Thus, the sperm\nwhale and the humpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the\nsimilitude
    ceases. Then this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland\nwhale, each of these
    has baleen; but there again the similitude\nceases. And it is just the same with
    the other parts above\nmentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such
    irregular\ncombinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an\nirregular
    isolation; as utterly to defy all general methodization\nformed upon such a basis.
    On this rock every one of the\nwhale-naturalists has split.\n  But it may possibly
    be conceived that, in the internal parts of\nthe whale, in his anatomy- there,
    at least, we shall be able to hit\nthe right classification. Nay; what thing,
    for example, is there in\nthe Greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his
    baleen? Yet we\nhave seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify\nthe
    Greenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various\nleviathans,
    why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part\nas available to the
    systematizer as those external ones already\nenumerated. What then remains? nothing
    but to take hold of the\nwhales bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly
    sort them\nthat way. And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and\nit
    is the only one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is\npracticable. To proceed.\n 
    BOOK I. (Folio) CHAPTER IV. (Hump Back).- This whale is often seen\non the northern
    American coast. He has been frequently captured there,\nand towed into harbor.
    He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or\nyou might call him the Elephant
    and Castle whale. At any rate, the\npopular name for him does not sufficiently
    distinguish him, since\nthe sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one.
    His oil is not\nvery valuable. He has baleen. He is the most gamesome and\nlight-hearted
    of all the whales, making more gay foam and white\nwater generally than any other
    of them.\n  BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER V. (Razar Back).- Of this whale little is\nknown
    but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of\na retiring nature,
    he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though\nno coward, he has never yet
    shown any part of him but his back,\nwhich rises in a long sharp ridge. Let him
    go. I know little more of\nhim, nor does anybody else.\n  BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER
    VI. (Sulphur Bottom).- Another retiring\ngentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless
    got by scraping along the\nTartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings.
    He is seldom\nseen; at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern\nseas,
    and then always at too great a distance to study his\ncountenance. He is never
    chased; he would run away with rope-walks\nof line. Prodigies are told of him.
    Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say\nnothing more that is true of ye, nor can the
    oldest Nantucketer.\n  Thus ends BOOK I. (Folio), and now begins BOOK II. (Octavo).\n 
    OCTAVOES.* These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among\nwhich present
    may be numbered:- I., the Grampus; II., the Black\nFish; III., the Narwhale;
    IV., the Thrasher; V., the Killer.\n\n  *Why this book of whales is not denominated
    the Quarto is very\nplain. Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller
    than\nthose of the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate\nlikeness
    to them in figure, yet the bookbinder's Quarto volume in\nits dimensioned form
    does not preserve the shape of the Folio\nvolume, but the Octavo volume does.\n\n 
    BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER I. (Grampus).- Though this fish, whose\nloud sonorous
    breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to\nlandsmen, is so well
    known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not\npopularly classed among whales. But
    possessing all the grand\ndistinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists
    have\nrecognised him for one. He is of moderate octave size, varying from\nfifteen
    to twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions\nround the waist.
    He swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted,\nthough his oil is considerable
    in quantity, and pretty good for light.\nBy some fishermen his approach is regarded
    as premonitory of the\nadvance of the great sperm whale.\n  BOOK II. (Octavo),
    CHAPTER II. (Black Fish).- I give the popular\nfishermen's names for all these
    fish, for generally they are the best.\nWhere any name happens to be vague or
    inexpressive, I shall say so,\nand suggest another. I do so now touching the
    Black Fish, so called\nbecause blackness is the rule among almost all whales.
    So, call him\nthe Hyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known and
    from\nthe circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards,\nhe
    carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale\naverages
    some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in\nalmost all latitudes.
    He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal\nhooked fin in swimming, which looks
    something like a Roman nose.\nWhen not more profitably employed, the sperm whale
    hunters sometimes\ncapture the Hyena whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil
    for\ndomestic employment- as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of\ncompany,
    and quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead\nof odorous wax.
    Though their blubber is very thin, some of these\nwhales will yield you upwards
    of thirty gallons of oil.\n  BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER III. (Narwhale), that
    is, Nostril whale.-\nAnother instance of a curiously named whale, so named I
    suppose from\nhis peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose.
    The\ncreature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages\nfive feet,
    though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet.\nStrictly speaking,
    this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out\nfrom the jaw in a line a little
    depressed from the horizontal. But\nit is only found on the sinister side, which
    has an ill effect, giving\nits owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy
    left-handed\nman. What precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would\nbe
    hard to say. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the\nsword-fish and
    bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the\nNarwhale employs it for a rake
    in turning over the bottom of the sea\nfor food. Charley Coffin said it was used
    for an ice-piercer; for\nthe Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea,
    and finding it\nsheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through.
    But\nyou cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct. My own\nopinion
    is, that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the\nNarwhale- however
    that may be- it would certainly be very convenient\nto him for a folder in reading
    pamphlets. The Narwhale I have heard\ncalled the Tusked whale, the Horned whale,
    and the Unicorn whale. He\nis certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to
    be found in almost\nevery kingdom of animated nature. From certain cloistered
    old\nauthors I have gathered that this same sea-unicorn's horn was in\nancient
    days regarded as the great antidote against poison, and as\nsuch, preparations
    of it brought immense prices. It was also distilled\nto a volatile salts for
    fainting ladies the same way that the horns of\nthe male deer are manufactured
    into hartshorn. Originally it was in\nitself accounted an object of great curiosity.
    Black Letter tells me\nthat Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage,
    when Queen\nBess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of\nGreenwich
    Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; \"when Sir\nMartin returned
    from that voyage,\" saith Black Letter, \"on bended\nknees he presented to her
    highness a prodigious long horn of the\nNarwhale, which for a long period after
    hung in the castle at\nWindsor.\" An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester,
    on\nbended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn,\npertaining
    to a land beast of the unicorn nature.\n  The Narwhale has a very picturesque,
    leopard-like look, being of a\nmilk-white ground color, dotted with round and
    oblong spots of\nblack. His oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is
    little\nof it, and he is seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the\ncircumpolar
    seas.\n  BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER IV. (Killer).- Of this whale little is\nprecisely
    known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the\nprofessed naturalists. From
    what I have seen of him at a distance, I\nshould say that he was about the bigness
    of a grampus. He is very\nsavage- a sort of Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the
    great Folio\nwhales by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the mighty
    brute\nis worried to death. The Killer is never hunted. I never heard what\nsort
    of oil he has. Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon\nthis whale,
    on the ground of its indistinctness. For we are all\nkillers, on land and on
    sea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.\n  BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER V. (Thrasher).-
    This gentleman is\nfamous for his tail which he uses for a ferule in thrashing
    his\nfoes. He mounts the Folio whale's back, and as he swims, he works\nhis passage
    by flogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the\nworld by a similar process.
    Still less is known of the Thrasher than\nof the Killer. Both are outlaws, even
    in the lawless seas.\n  Thus ends BOOK II. (Octavo), and begins BOOK III, (Duodecimo.)\n 
    DUODECIMOES.- These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza\nPorpoise. II. The
    Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.\n  To those who have not
    chanced specially to study the subject, it may\npossibly seem strange, that fishes
    not commonly exceeding four or five\nfeet should be marshalled among WHALES-
    a word, which, in the\npopular sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But
    the creatures\nset down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms
    of\nmy definition of what a whale is- i.e. a spouting fish, with a\nhorizontal
    tail.\n  BOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER 1. (Huzza Porpoise).- This is the\ncommon
    porpoise found all over the globe. The name is of my own\nbestowal; for there
    are more than one sort of porpoises, and something\nmust be done to distinguish
    them. I call him thus, because he always\nswims in hilarious shoals, which upon
    the broad sea keep tossing\nthemselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July
    crowd. Their\nappearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full
    of\nfine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to\nwindward.
    They are the lads that always live before the wind. They are\naccounted a lucky
    omen. If you yourself can withstand three cheers\nat beholding these vivacious
    fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit\nof godly gamesomeness is not in ye. A
    well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise\nwill yield you one good gallon of good oil. But
    the fine and\ndelicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable.
    It\nis in request among jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put in on their\nhones.
    Porpoise meat is good eating, you know. It may never have\noccurred to you that
    a porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so\nsmall that it is not very readily
    discernible. But the next time you\nhave a chance, watch him; and you will then
    see the great Sperm\nwhale himself in miniature.\n  BOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER
    II. (Algerine Porpoise).- A pirate.\nVery savage. He is only found, I think,
    in the Pacific. He is somewhat\nlarger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the
    same general make.\nProvoke him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered
    for him\nmany times, but never yet saw him captured.\n  BOOK III. (Duodecimo),
    CHAPTER III. (Mealy-mouthed Porpoise).- The\nlargest kind of Porpoise; and only
    found in the Pacific, so far as\nit is known. The only English name, by which
    he has hitherto been\ndesignated, is that of the fisher- Right-Whale Porpoise,
    from the\ncircumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio.\nIn
    shape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being\nof a less rotund
    and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and\ngentleman-like figure. He
    has no fins on his back (most other\nporpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and
    sentimental Indian eyes\nof a hazel hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils him. Though
    his entire back\ndown to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line,\ndistinct
    as the mark in a ship's hull, called the \"bright waist,\" that\nline streaks
    him from stem to stern, with two separate colors, black\nabove and white below.
    The white comprises part of his head, and the\nwhole of his mouth, which makes
    him look as if he had just escaped\nfrom a felonious visit to a meal-bag. A most
    mean and mealy aspect!\nHis oil is much like that of the common porpoise.\n\n 
    Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as\nthe Porpoise
    is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the\nLeviathans of note. But
    there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,\nhalf-fabulous whales, which, as an
    American whaleman, I know by\nreputation, but not personally. I shall enumerate
    them by their\nfore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable\nto
    future investigators, who may complete what I have here but\nbegun. If any of
    the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and\nmarked, then he can readily
    be incorporated into this System,\naccording to his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo
    magnitude:- The\nBottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale;
    the\nCape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the\nCoppered
    Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale;\nthe Blue Whale;
    &c. From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English\nauthorities, there might be quoted
    other lists of uncertain whales,\nblessed with all manner of uncouth names. But
    I omit them as\naltogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them for
    mere\nsounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing.\n  Finally: It was
    stated at the outset, that this system would not\nbe here, and at once, perfected.
    You cannot but plainly see that I\nhave kept my word. But I now leave my cetological
    System standing thus\nunfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was
    left, with\nthe cranes still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower.
    For\nsmall erections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones,\ntrue
    ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God keep me from\never completing
    anything. This whole book is but a draught- nay, but\nthe draught of a draught.
    Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!\n  "
