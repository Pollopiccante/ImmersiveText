  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 28,   Ahab
  content: "\n  Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority\nordered
    the scattered people to condense. \"Star board gangway,\nthere! side away to
    larboard- larboard gangway to starboard! Midships!\nmidships!\"\n  There was
    a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a\nstill slighter shuffling
    of women's shoes, and all was quiet again,\nand every eye on the preacher.\n 
    He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit's bows, folded his\nlarge brown
    hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and\noffered a prayer so deeply
    devout that he seemed kneeling and\npraying at the bottom of the sea.\n  This
    ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of\na bell in a
    ship that is foundering at sea in a fog- in such tones\nhe commenced reading
    the following hymn; but changing his manner\ntowards the concluding stanzas,
    burst forth with a pealing\nexultation and joy-\n\n          The ribs and terrors
    in the whale,\n            Arched over me a dismal gloom,\n          While all
    God's sun-lit waves rolled by,\n            And lift me deepening down to doom.\n\n         
    I saw the opening maw of hell,\n            With endless pains and sorrows there;\n         
    Which none but they that feel can tell-\n            Oh, I was plunging to despair.\n\n         
    In black distress, I called my God,\n            When I could scarce believe
    him mine,\n          He bowed his ear to my complaints-\n            No more
    the whale did me confine.\n\n          With speed he flew to my relief,\n           
    As on a radiant dolphin borne;\n          Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone\n           
    The face of my Deliverer God.\n\n          My song for ever shall record\n           
    That terrible, that joyful hour;\n          I give the glory to my God,\n           
    His all the mercy and the power.\n\n  Nearly all joined in singing this hymn,
    which swelled high above the\nhowling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the
    preacher slowly turned\nover the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his
    hand down\nupon the proper page, said: \"Beloved shipmates, clinch the last\nverse
    of the first chapter of Jonah- 'And God had prepared a great\nfish to swallow
    up Jonah.'\"\n  \"Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters- four yarns-
    is\none of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet\nwhat
    depths of the soul Jonah's deep sealine sound! what a pregnant\nlesson to us
    is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in\nthe fish's belly! How
    billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel\nthe floods surging over us, we sound
    with him to the kelpy bottom of\nthe waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the
    sea is about us! But\nwhat is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates,
    it is a\ntwo-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson
    to\nme as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us\nall,
    because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly\nawakened fears,
    the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally\nthe deliverance and joy
    of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the\nsin of this son of Amittai was
    in his wilful disobedience of the\ncommand of God- never mind now what that command
    was, or how conveyed-\nwhich he found a hard command. But all the things that
    God would\nhave us do are hard for us to do- remember that- and hence, he oftener\ncommands
    us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we must\ndisobey ourselves;
    and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the\nhardness of obeying God
    consists.\n  \"With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts
    at\nGod, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men,\nwill
    carry him into countries where God does not reign but only the\nCaptains of this
    earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and\nseeks a ship that's bound for
    Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a\nhitherto unheeded meaning here. By all accounts
    Tarshish could have\nbeen no other city than the modern Cadiz. That's the opinion
    of\nlearned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as\nfar by
    water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those\nancient days,
    when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because\nJoppa, the modern Jaffa,
    shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of\nthe Mediterranean, the Syrian; and
    Tarshish or Cadiz more than two\nthousand miles to the westward from that, just
    outside the Straits\nof Gibraltar. See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought
    to flee\nworldwide from God? Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy
    of\nall scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God;\nprowling
    among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the\nseas. So disordered,
    self-condemning in his look, that had there\nbeen policemen in those days, Jonah,
    on the mere suspicion of\nsomething wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a
    deck. How\nplainly he's a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or\ncarpet-bag,-
    no friends accompany him to the wharf with their\nadieux. At last, after much
    dodging search, he finds the Tarshish ship\nreceiving the last items of her cargo;
    and as he steps on board to see\nits Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for
    the moment desist from\nhoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger's evil eye.
    Jonah sees\nthis; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence; in vain\nessays
    his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure the\nmariners he can
    be no innocent. In their gamesome but still serious\nway, one whispers to the
    other- \"Jack, he's robbed a widow;\" or, \"Joe,\ndo you mark him; he's a bigamist;\"
    or, \"Harry lad, I guess he's the\nadulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah,
    or belike, one of the\nmissing murderers from Sodom.\" Another runs to read the
    bill that's\nstuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored,\noffering
    five hundred gold coins for the apprenhension of a parricide,\nand containing
    a description of his person. He reads, and looks from\nJonah to the bill; while
    all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round\nJonah, prepared to lay their hands
    upon him. Frightened Jonah\ntrembles. and summoning all his boldness to his face,
    only looks so\nmuch the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected;
    but\nthat itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and\nwhen the
    sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they\nlet him pass, and
    he descends into the cabin.\n  \"'Who's there?' cries the Captain at his busy
    desk, hurriedly making\nout his papers for the Customs- 'Who's there?' Oh! how
    that harmless\nquestion mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee
    again.\nBut he rallies. 'I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon\nsail
    ye, sir?' Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah,\nthough the man
    now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear\nthat hollow voice, than he
    darts a scrutinizing glance. 'We sail\nwith the next coming tide,' at last he
    slowly answered, still intently\neyeing him. 'No sooner, sir?'- 'Soon enough
    for any honest man that\ngoes a passenger.' Ha! Jonah, that's another stab. But
    he swiftly\ncalls away the Captain from that scent. 'I'll sail with ye,'- he\nsays,-
    'the passage money how much is that?- I'll pay now.' For it\nis particularly
    written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be\noverlooked in this history,
    'that he paid the fare thereof' ere the\ncraft did sail. And taken with the context,
    this is full of meaning.\n  \"Now Jonah's Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment
    detects\ncrime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless.\nIn
    this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely\nand without a
    passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all\nfrontiers. So Jonah's
    Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah's\npurse, ere he judge him openly.
    He charges him thrice the usual sum;\nand it's assented to. Then the Captain
    knows that Jonah is a fugitive;\nbut at the same time resolves to help a flight
    that paves its rear\nwith gold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent\nsuspicions
    still molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a\ncounterfeit. Not a forger,
    any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put\ndown for his passage. 'Point out my state-room,
    Sir,' says Jonah\nnow, 'I'm travel-weary; I need sleep.' 'Thou lookest like it,'
    says\nthe Captain, 'there's thy room.' Jonah enters, and would lock the\ndoor,
    but the lock contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling\nthere, the Captain
    laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something\nabout the doors of convicts'
    cells being never allowed to be locked\nwithin. All dressed and dusty as he is,
    Jonah throws himself into\nhis berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling
    almost resting on\nhis forehead. The air is close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in
    that\ncontracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship's water-line, Jonah feels\nthe
    heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the whale shall\nhold him
    in the smallest of his bowels' wards.\n  \"Screwed at its axis against the side,
    a swinging lamp slightly\noscillates in Jonah's room; and the ship, heeling over
    towards the\nwharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame\nand
    all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent\nobliquity with reference
    to the room; though, in truth, infallibly\nstraight itself, it but made obvious
    the false, lying levels among\nwhich it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah;
    as lying in his\nberth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus
    far\nsuccessful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But\nthat contradiction
    in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor,\nthe ceiling, and the side,
    are all awry. 'Oh! so my conscience hangs\nin me!' he groans, 'straight upwards,
    so it burns; but the chambers of\nmy soul are all in crookedness!'\n  \"Like
    one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed,\nstill reeling, but
    with conscience yet pricking him, as the\nplungings of the Roman race-horse but
    so much the more strike his\nsteel tags into him; as one who in that miserable
    plight still turns\nand turns in giddy anguish, praying God for annihilation
    until the fit\nbe passed; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep
    stupor\nsteals over him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience\nis
    the wound, and there's naught to staunch it; so, after sore\nwrestling in his
    berth, Jonah's prodigy of ponderous misery drags\nhim drowning down to sleep.\n 
    \"And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables;\nand from
    the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all\ncareening, glides to
    sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of\nrecorded smugglers! the contraband
    was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he\nwill not bare the wicked burden. A dreadful
    storm comes on, the ship\nis like to break. But now when the boatswain calls
    all hands to\nlighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard;\nwhen
    the wind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank\nthunders with
    trampling feet right over Jonah's head; in all this\nraging tumult, Jonah sleeps
    his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky\nand raging sea, feels not the reeling
    timbers, and little hears he\nor heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which
    even now with open\nmouth is cleaving the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah
    was gone\ndown into the sides of the ship- a berth in the cabin as I have\ntaken
    it, and was fast asleep. But the frightened master comes to him,\nand shrieks
    in his dead ear, 'What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!'\nStartled from his lethargy
    by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to\nhis feet, and stumbling to the deck,
    grasps a shroud, to look out upon\nthe sea. But at that moment he is sprung upon
    by a panther billow\nleaping over the bulwarks. Wave after wave thus leaps into
    the ship,\nand finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the\nmariners
    come nigh to drowning while yet afloat. And ever, as the\nwhite moon shows her
    affrighted face from the steep gullies in the\nblackness overhead, aghast Jonah
    sees the rearing bowsprit pointing\nhigh upward, but soon beat downward again
    towards the tormented deep.\n  \"Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his
    soul. In all his\ncringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known.
    The\nsailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of\nhim, and
    at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole\nmatter to high Heaven,
    they all-outward to casting lots, to see for\nwhose cause this great tempest
    was upon them. The lot is Jonah's; that\ndiscovered, then how furiously they
    mob him with their questions.\n'What is thine occupation? Whence comest thou?
    Thy country? What\npeople? But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah.
    The\neager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from; whereas, they\nnot
    only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise another\nanswer to a
    question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer is\nforced from Jonah by
    the hard hand of God that is upon him.\n  \"'I am a Hebrew,' he cries- and then-
    'I fear the Lord the God of\nHeaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!'
    Fear him, O Jonah?\nAye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God then! Straightway,
    he now\ngoes on to make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became\nmore
    and more appalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet\nsupplicating
    God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of\nhis deserts,- when
    wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and\ncast him forth into the sea,
    for he knew that for his sake this\ngreat tempest was upon them; they mercifully
    turn from him, and seek\nby other means to save the ship. But all in vain; the
    indignant gale\nhowls louder; then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with
    the\nother they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.\n  \"And now behold Jonah
    taken up as an anchor and dropped into the\nsea; when instantly an oily calmness
    floats out from the east, and the\nsea is as Jonah carries down the gale with
    him, leaving smooth water\nbehind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such
    a masterless\ncommotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething\ninto
    the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his\nivory teeth,
    like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah\nprayed unto the Lord out
    of the fish's belly. But observe his\nprayer, and learn a weighty lesson. For
    sinful as he is, Jonah does\nnot weep and wail for direct deliverance. He feels
    that his dreadful\npunishment is just. He leaves all his deliverance to God,
    contenting\nhimself with this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will\nstill
    look towards His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true and\nfaithful repentance;
    not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for\npunishment. And how pleasing to God
    was this conduct in Jonah, is\nshown in the eventual deliverance of him from
    the sea and the whale.\nShipmates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied
    for his sin\nbut I do place him before you as a model for repentance. Sin not;\nbut
    if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah.\"\n  While he was speaking these
    words, the howling of the shrieking,\nslanting storm without seemed to add new
    power to the preacher, who,\nwhen describing Jonah's sea-storm, seemed tossed
    by a storm himself.\nHis deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed
    arms seemed\nthe warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away
    from\noff his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his\nsimple
    hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.\n  There now
    came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the\nleaves of the Book once
    more; and, at last, standing motionless,\nwith closed eyes, for the moment, seemed
    communing with God and\nhimself.\n  But again he leaned over towards the people,
    and bowing his head\nlowly, with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility,
    he spake\nthese words:\n  \"Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both
    his hands press\nupon me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the
    lesson\nthat Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more\nto
    me, for I am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I\ncome down
    from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you\nsit, and listen as
    you listen, while some one of you reads me that\nother and more awful lesson
    which Jonah teaches to me, as a pilot of\nthe living God. How being an anointed
    pilot-prophet, or speaker of\ntrue things and bidden by the Lord to sound those
    unwelcome truths\nin the ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility
    he\nshould raise, fled from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and\nhis
    God by taking ship at Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he\nnever reached.
    As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and\nswallowed him down to living
    gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings\ntore him along 'into the midst of the
    seas,' where the eddying\ndepths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and 'the
    weeds were\nwrapped about his head,' and all the watery world of woe bowled over\nhim.
    Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet- 'out of the\nbelly of hell'- when
    the whale grounded upon the ocean's utmost bones,\neven then, God heard the engulphed,
    repenting prophet when he cried.\nThen God spake unto the fish; and from the
    shuddering cold and\nblackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up towards
    the warm and\npleasant sun, and all the delights of air and earth; and 'vomited\nout
    Jonah upon the dry land;' when the word of the Lord came a\nsecond time; and
    Jonah, bruised and beaten- his ears, like two\nsea-shells, still multitudinously
    murmuring of the ocean- Jonah did\nthe Almighty's bidding. And what was that,
    shipmates? To preach the\nTruth to the face of Falsehood! That was it!\n  \"This,
    shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot\nof the living God
    who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms\nfrom Gospel duty! Woe to him
    who seeks to pour oil upon the waters\nwhen God has brewed them into a gale!
    Woe to him who seeks to please\nrather than to appal! Woe to him whose good name
    is more to him than\ngoodness! Woe to him who, in this world, courts not dishonor!
    Woe to\nhim who would not be true, even though to be false were salvation!\nYea,
    woe to him who as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching to\nothers is
    himself a castaway!\n  He drooped and fell away from himself for a moment; then
    lifting his\nface to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out\nwith
    a heavenly enthusiasm,- \"But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand\nof every
    woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that\ndelight, than the bottom
    of the woe is deep. Is not the main-truck\nhigher than the kelson is low? Delight
    is to him- a far, far upward,\nand inward delight- who against the proud gods
    and commodores of\nthis earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight
    is to\nhim whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of this base\ntreacherous
    world has gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who\ngives no quarter in
    the truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all\nsin though he pluck it out from
    under the robes of Senators and\nJudges. Delight,- top-gallant delight is to
    him, who acknowledges no\nlaw or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a patriot
    to heaven.\nDelight is to him, whom all the waves of the billows of the seas
    of\nthe boisterous mob can never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages.\nAnd
    eternal delight and deliciousness will be his, who coming to lay\nhim down, can
    say with his final breath- O Father!- chiefly known to\nme by Thy rod- mortal
    or immortal, here I die. I have striven to be\nThine, more than to be this world's,
    or mine own. Yet this is nothing:\nI leave eternity to Thee; for what is man
    that he should live out\nthe lifetime of his God?\"\n  He said no more, but slowly
    waving a benediction, covered his face\nwith his hands, and so remained kneeling,
    till all the people had\ndeparted, and he was left alone in the place.\n  "
