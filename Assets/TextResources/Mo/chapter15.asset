  content: "\n  I quickley followed suit, and descending into the bar-room\naccosted
    the grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no\nmalice towards him, though
    he had been skylarking with me not a little\nin the matter of my bedfellow.\n 
    However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too\nscarce a good thing;
    the more's the pity. So, if any one man, in his\nown proper person, afford stuff
    for a good joke to anybody, let him\nnot be backward, but let him cheerfully
    allow himself to spend and\nto be spent in that way. And the man that has anything
    bountifully\nlaughable about him, be sure there is more in that man than you\nperhaps
    think for.\n  The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping
    in\nthe night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They\nwere
    nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third\nmates, and sea
    carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and\nharpooneers, and ship
    keepers; a brown and brawny company, with\nbosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set,
    all wearing monkey jackets for\nmorning gowns.\n  You could pretty plainly tell
    how long each one had been ashore.\nThis young fellow's healthy cheek is like
    a sun-toasted pear in hue,\nand would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot
    have been three\ndays landed from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks
    a few\nshades lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In\nthe
    complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly\nbleached withal;
    he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But\nwho could show a cheek like
    Queequeg? which, barred with various\ntints, seemed like the Andes' western slope,
    to show forth in one\narray, contrasting climates, zone by zone.\n  \"Grub, ho!\"
    now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in\nwe went to breakfast.\n 
    They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at\nease in manner,
    quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though:\nLedyard, the great New
    England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch\none; of all men, they possessed
    the least assurance in the parlor. But\nperhaps the mere crossing of Siberia
    in a sledge drawn by dogs as\nLedyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk
    on an empty stomach,\nin the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor
    Mungo's\nperformances- this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best\nmode
    of attaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part, that\nsort of thing
    is to be had anywhere.\n  These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance\nthat
    after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to\nhear some good
    stories about whaling; to my no small surprise nearly\nevery man maintained a
    profound silence. And not only that, but they\nlooked embarrassed. Yes, here
    were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom\nwithout the slightest bashfulness had boarded
    great whales on the high\nseas- entire strangers to them- and duelled them dead
    without winking;\nand yet, here they sat at a social breakfast table- all of
    the same\ncalling, all of kindred tastes- looking round as sheepishly at each\nother
    as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold\namong the Green
    Mountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these\ntimid warrior whalemen!\n 
    But as for Queequeg- why, Queequeg sat there among them- at the head\nof the
    table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I\ncannot say much
    for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not\nhave cordially justified his
    bringing his harpoon into breakfast\nwith him, and using it there without ceremony;
    reaching over the table\nwith it, to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and
    grappling the\nbeefsteaks towards him. But that was certainly very coolly done
    by\nhim, and every one knows that in most people's estimation, to do\nanything
    coolly is to do it genteelly.\n  We will not speak of all Queequeg's peculiarities
    here; how he\neschewed coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention\nto
    beefsteaks, done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he\nwithdrew like
    the rest into the public room, lighted his\ntomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there
    quietly digesting and smoking\nwith his inseparable hat on, when I sallied out
    for a stroll.\n  "
