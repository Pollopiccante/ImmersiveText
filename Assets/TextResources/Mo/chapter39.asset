  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 40,   Midnight, Forecastle
  content: "\n  Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a\nbarber,
    for a block, I settled my own and comrade's bill; using,\nhowever, my comrade's
    money. The grinning landlord, as well as the\nboarders, seemed amazingly tickled
    at the sudden friendship which\nhad sprung up between me and Queequeg- especially
    as Peter Coffin's\ncock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed
    me\nconcerning the very person whom I now companied with.\n  We borrowed a wheelbarrow,
    and embarking our things, including my\nown poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg's canvas
    sack and hammock, away we\nwent down to \"the Moss,\" the little Nantucket packet
    schooner moored\nat the wharf. As we were going along the people stared; not
    at\nQueequeg so much- for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in\ntheir
    streets,- but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms.\nBut we heeded
    them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns,\nand Queequeg now and then
    stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon\nbarbs. I asked him why he carried
    such a troublesome thing with him\nashore, and whether all whaling ships did
    not find their own harpoons.\nTo this, in substance, he replied, that though
    what I hinted was\ntrue enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own
    harpoon,\nbecause it was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat,\nand
    deeply intimate with the hearts of whales. In short, like many\nreapers and mowers,
    who go into the farmer's meadows armed with\ntheir own scythes- though in no
    wise obliged to furnish them- even so,\nQueequeg, for his own private reasons,
    preferred his own harpoon.\n  Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told
    me a funny story\nabout the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag
    Harbor.\nThe owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to\ncarry
    his heavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant\nabout the thing-
    though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the\nprecise way in which to manage
    the barrow- Queequeg puts his chest\nupon it; lashes it fast; and then shoulders
    the barrow and marches\nup the wharf. \"Why,\" said I, \"Queequeg, you might
    have known better\nthan that, one would think. Didn't the people laugh?\"\n 
    Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of\nRokovoko, it
    seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water\nof young cocoanuts
    into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and\nthis punchbowl always forms
    the great central ornament on the\nbraided mat where the feast is held. Now a
    certain grand merchant ship\nonce touched at Rokovoko, and its commander- from
    all accounts, a very\nstately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain-
    this\ncommander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg's sister, a\npretty
    young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding\nguests were assembled
    at the bride's bamboo cottage, this Captain\nmarches in, and being assigned the
    post of honor, placed himself\nover against the punchbowl, and between the High
    Priest and his\nmajesty the King, Queequeg's father. Grace being said,- for those\npeople
    have their grace as well as we- though Queequeg told me that\nunlike us, who
    at such times look downwards to our platters, they,\non the contrary, copying
    the ducks, glance upwards to the great\nGiver of all feasts- Grace, I say, being
    said, the High Priest opens\nthe banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island;
    that is, dipping\nhis consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before
    the\nblessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest,\nand
    noting the ceremony, and thinking himself- being Captain of a\nship- as having
    plain precedence over a mere island King, especially\nin the King's own house-
    the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands\nin the punch bowl;- taking it
    I suppose for a huge finger-glass.\n\"Now,\" said Queequeg, \"what you tink now?-
    Didn't our people laugh?\"\n  At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood
    on board the\nschooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On
    one\nside, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees\nall
    glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of\ncasks on casks
    were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the\nworld-wandering whale ships
    lay silent and safely moored at last;\nwhile from others came a sound of carpenters
    and coopers, with blended\nnoises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all
    betokening that\nnew cruises were on the start; that one most perilous and long\nvoyage
    ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins\na third, and so
    on, for ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness,\nyea, the intolerableness
    of all earthly effort.\n  Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed
    fresh; the\nlittle Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt
    his\nsnortings. How I snuffed that Tartar air!- how I spurned that turnpike\nearth!-
    that common highway all over dented with the marks of\nslavish heels and hoofs;
    and turned me to admire the magnanimity of\nthe sea which will permit no records.\n 
    At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with\nme. His dusky
    nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and\npointed teeth. On, on we flew,
    and our offing gained, the Moss did\nhomage to the blast; ducked and dived her
    bows as a slave before the\nSultan. Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every
    ropeyarn\ntingling like a wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes
    in\nland tornadoes. So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood\nby the
    plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the\njeering glances
    of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who\nmarvelled that two fellow beings
    should be so companionable; as though\na white man were anything more dignified
    than a whitewashed negro. But\nthere were some boobies and bumpkins there, who,
    by their intense\ngreenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all
    verdure.\nQueequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his\nback.
    I thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come. Dropping his\nharpoon, the brawny
    savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost\nmiraculous dexterity and strength,
    sent him high up bodily into the\nair; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset,
    the fellow\nlanded with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning\nhis
    back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a\npuff.\n 
    \"Capting! Capting! yelled the bumpkin, running toward that\nofficer; \"Capting,
    Capting, here's the devil.\"\n  \"Hallo, you sir,\" cried the Captain, a gaunt
    rib of the sea,\nstalking up to Queequeg, \"what in thunder do you mean by that?
    Don't\nyou know you might have killed that chap?\"\n  \"What him say?\" said
    Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.\n  \"He say,\" said I, \"that you came near
    kill-e that man there,\"\npointing to the still shivering greenhorn.\n  \"Kill-e,\"
    cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an\nunearthly expression of disdain,
    \"ah! him bevy small-e fish-e;\nQueequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg
    kill-e big whale!\"\n  \"Look you,\" roared the Captain, \"I'll kill-e you, you
    cannibal, if\nyou try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.\"\n 
    But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the\nCaptain to mind
    his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the\nmain-sail had parted the weather-sheet,
    and the tremendous boom was\nnow flying from side to side, completely sweeping
    the entire after\npart of the deck. The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled
    so\nroughly, was swept overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to\nattempt
    snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness. It flew from\nright to left,
    and back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and\nevery instant seemed on
    the point of snapping into splinters.\nNothing was done, and nothing seemed capable
    of being done; those on\ndeck rushed toward the bows, and stood eyeing the boom
    as if it were\nthe lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of this\nconsternation,
    Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling\nunder the path of the boom,
    whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to\nthe bulwarks, and then flinging the
    other like a lasso, caught it\nround the boom as it swept over his head, and
    at the next jerk, the\nspar was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner
    was run into\nthe wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat,\nQueequeg,
    stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long\nliving arc of a leap.
    For three minutes or more he was seen swimming\nlike a dog, throwing his long
    arms straight out before him, and by\nturns revealing his brawny shoulders through
    the freezing foam. I\nlooked at the grand and glorious but saw no one to be saved.
    The\ngreenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the\nwater,
    Queequeg, now took an instant's glance around him, and\nseeming to see just how
    matters were, dived down and disappeared. A\nfew minutes more, and he rose again,
    one arm still striking out, and\nwith the other dragging a lifeless form. The
    boat soon picked them up.\nThe poor bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg
    a noble trump;\nthe captain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg
    like\na barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.\n  Was there
    ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that\nhe at all deserved
    a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous\nSocieties. He only asked for water-
    fresh water- something to wipe the\nbrine off; that done, he put on dry clothes,
    lighted his pipe, and\nleaning against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those
    around him,\nseemed to be saying to himself- \"It's a mutual, joint-stock world,\nin
    all meridians. We cannibals must help these Christians.\"\n  "
