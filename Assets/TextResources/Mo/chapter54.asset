  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 55,   Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales
  content: "\n  As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship,\nQueequeg
    carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly\nhailed us from
    his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a\ncannibal, and furthermore
    announcing that he let no cannibals on board\nthat craft, unless they previously
    produced their papers.\n  \"What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?\" said I,
    now jumping on\nthe bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.\n 
    \"I mean,\" he replied, \"he must show his papers.\"\n  \"Yes,\" said Captain
    Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head\nfrom behind Peleg's, out of the
    wigwam. \"He must show that he's\nconverted. Son of darkness,\" he added, turning
    to Queequeg, \"art\nthou at present in communion with any Christian church?\"\n 
    \"Why,\" said I, \"he's a member of the first Congregational Church.\"\nHere
    be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships\nat last come
    to be converted into the churches.\n  \"First Congregational Church,\" cried
    Bildad, \"what! that worships in\nDeacon Deuteronomy Coleman's meeting-house?\"
    and so saying, taking out\nhis spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow
    bandana\nhandkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the\nwigwam,
    and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look\nat Queequeg.\n 
    \"How long hath he been a member?\" he then said, turning to me;\n\"not very
    long, I rather guess, young man.\"\n  \"No,\" said Peleg, \"and he hasn't been
    baptized right either, or it\nwould have washed some of that devil's blue off
    his face.\"\n  \"Do tell, now,\" cried Bildad, \"is this Philistine a regular
    member\nof Deacon Deuteronomy's meeting? I never saw him going there, and I\npass
    it every Lord's day.\"\n  \"I don't know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or
    his meeting,\"\nsaid I; \"all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member
    of the\nFirst Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.\"\n 
    \"Young man,\" said Bildad sternly, \"thou art skylarking with me-\nexplain thyself,
    thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean?\nanswer me.\"\n  Finding myself
    thus hard pushed, I replied, \"I mean, sir, the same\nancient Catholic Church
    to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there,\nand Queequeg here, and all of us,
    and every mother's son and soul of\nus belong; the great and everlasting First
    Congregation of this\nwhole worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some
    of us\ncherish some crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in that we\nall
    join hands.\"\n  \"Splice, thou mean'st splice hands,\" cried Peleg, drawing
    nearer.\n\"Young man, you'd better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast\nhand;
    I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy- why Father\nMapple himself
    couldn't beat it, and he's reckoned something. Come\naboard, come aboard: never
    mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog\nthere- what's that you call him? tell
    Quohog to step along. By the\ngreat anchor, what a harpoon he's got there! looks
    like good stuff\nthat; and he handles it about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever
    your\nname is, did you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you\never
    strike a fish?\"\n  Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way,
    jumped\nupon the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats\nhanging
    to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his\nharpoon, cried
    out in some such way as this:-\n  \"Cap'ain, you see him small drop tar on water
    dere? You see him?\nwell, spose him one whale eye, well, den!\" and taking sharp
    aim at it,\nhe darted the iron right over old Bildad's broad brim, clean across\nthe
    ship's decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.\n  \"Now,\" said
    Queequeg, quietly, hauling in the line, \"spos-ee him\nwhale-e eye; why, dad
    whale dead.\"\n  \"Quick, Bildad,\" said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the
    close\nvicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin\ngangway.
    \"Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship's papers. We must\nhave Hedgehog
    there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye,\nQuohog, we'll give ye the
    ninetieth lay, and that's more than ever was\ngiven a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.\"\n 
    So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was\nsoon enrolled
    among the same ship's company to which I myself\nbelonged.\n  When all preliminaries
    were over and Peleg had got everything\nready for signing, he turned to me and
    said, \"I guess, Quohog there\ndon't know how to write, does he? I say, Quohog,
    blast ye! dost thou\nsign thy name or make thy mark?\n  But at this question,
    Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken\npart in similar ceremonies, looked
    no ways abashed; but taking the\noffered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper
    place, an exact\ncounterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon
    his arm;\nso that through Captain Peleg's obstinate mistake touching his\nappellative,
    it stood something like  this:-\n                             Quohog.\n                          
    his X mark.\nMeanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing\nQueequeg,
    and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets\nof his broadskirted
    drab coat took out a bundle of tracts, and\nselecting one entitled \"The Latter
    Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,\"\nplaced it in Queequeg's hands, and then grasping
    them and the book\nwith both his, looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, \"Son
    of\ndarkness, I must do my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and\nfeel
    concerned for the souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest\nto thy Pagan
    ways, which I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not\nfor aye a Belial bondsman.
    Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous\ndragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind
    thine eye, I say; oh!\ngoodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!\"\n 
    Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad's language,\nheterogeneously
    mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.\n  \"Avast there, avast there, Bildad,
    avast now spoiling our\nharpooneer,\" Peleg. \"Pious harpooneers never make good
    voyagers- it\ntakes the shark out of 'em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who
    aint\npretty sharkish. There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest\nboat-header
    out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the\nmeeting, and never came
    to good. He got so frightened about his plaguy\nsoul, that he shrinked and sheered
    away from whales, for fear of\nafter-claps, in case he got stove and went to
    Davy Jones.\"\n  \"Peleg! Peleg!\" said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, \"thou\nthyself,
    as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest,\nPeleg, what it is
    to have the fear of death; how, then, can'st thou\nprate in this ungodly guise.
    Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell\nme, when this same Pequod here had
    her three masts overboard in that\ntyphoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou
    went mate with Captain\nAhab, did'st thou not think of Death and the Judgment
    then?\"\n  \"Hear him, hear him now,\" cried Peleg, marching across the cabin,\nand
    thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,- \"hear him, all\nof ye. Think
    of that! When every moment we thought the ship would\nsink! Death and the Judgment
    then? What? With all three masts making\nsuch an everlasting thundering against
    the side; and every sea\nbreaking over us, fore and aft. Think of Death and the
    Judgment\nthen? No! no time to think about death then. Life was what Captain\nAhab
    and I was thinking of; and how to save all hands how to rig\njury-masts how to
    get into the nearest port; that was what I was\nthinking of.\"\n  Bildad said
    no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck,\nwhere we followed him.
    There he stood, very quietly overlooking some\nsailmakers who were mending a
    top-sail in the waist. Now and then he\nstooped to pick up a patch, or save an
    end of tarred twine, which\notherwise might have been wasted.\n  "
