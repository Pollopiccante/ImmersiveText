  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 124,   The Needle
  content: "\n  I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the\nrest;
    my oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and\nmore did I
    hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul.\nA wild, mystical,
    sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab's quenchless\nfeud seemed mine. With greedy
    ears I learned the history of that\nmurderous monster against whom I and all
    the others had taken our\noaths of violence and revenge.\n  For some time past,
    though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,\nsecluded White Whale had haunted
    those uncivilized seas mostly\nfrequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen. But not
    all of them knew of\nhis existence; a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly
    seen him;\nwhile the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle
    to\nhim, was small indeed. For, owing to the large number of\nwhale-cruisers;
    the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire\nwatery circumference,
    many of them adventurously pushing their quest\nalong solitary latitudes, so
    as seldom or never for a whole\ntwelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter
    a single news-telling\nsail of any sort; the inordinate length of each separate
    voyage; the\nirregularity of the times of sailing from home; all these, with\nother
    circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread\nthrough the whole
    world-wide whaling-fleet of the special\nindividualizing tidings concerning Moby
    Dick. It was hardly to be\ndoubted, that several vessels reported to have encountered,
    at such or\nsuch a time, or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of\nuncommon
    magnitude and malignity, which whale, after doing great\nmischief to his assailants,
    has completely escaped them; to some minds\nit was not an unfair presumption,
    I say, that the whale in question\nmust have been no other than Moby Dick. Yet
    as of late the Sperm Whale\nfishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent
    instances of\ngreat ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster attacked; therefore\nit
    was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby\nDick; such hunters,
    perhaps, for the most part, were content to\nascribe the peculiar terror he bred,
    more, as it were, to the perils\nof the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to
    the individual cause.\nIn that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between
    Ahab and the\nwhale had hitherto been popularly regarded.\n  And as for those
    who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by\nchance caught sight of him; in
    the beginning of the thing they had\nevery one of them, almost, as boldly and
    fearlessly lowered for him,\nas for any other whale of that species. But at length,
    such calamities\ndid ensue in these assaults- not restricted to sprained wrists
    and\nankles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations- but fatal to the\nlast degree
    of fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses, all\naccumulating and piling
    their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had\ngone far to shake the fortitude
    of many brave hunters, to whom the\nstory of the White Whale had eventually come.\n 
    Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the\nmore horrify
    the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not\nonly do fabulous rumors
    naturally grow out of the very body of all\nsurprising terrible events,- as the
    smitten tree gives birth to its\nfungi; but, in maritime life, far more than
    in that of terra firma,\nwild rumors abound, wherever there is any adequate reality
    for them to\ncling to. And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the\nwhale
    fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the\nwonderfulness and
    fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes\ncirculate there. For not only are
    whalemen as a body unexempt from\nthat ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary
    to all sailors; but of\nall sailors, they are by all odds the most directly brought
    into\ncontact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to\nface
    they not only eye its greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give\nbattle to them.
    Alone, in such remotest waters, that though you sailed\na thousand miles, and
    passed a thousand shores, you would not come\nto any chiselled hearth-stone,
    or aught hospitable beneath that part\nof the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes,
    pursuing too such a\ncalling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by influences
    all\ntending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth. No\nwonder,
    then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over\nthe wildest watery
    spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale\ndid in the end incorporate with
    themselves all manner of morbid hints,\nand half-formed foetal suggestions of
    supernatural agencies, which\neventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors
    unborrowed from\nanything that visibly appears. So that in many cases such a
    panic\ndid he finally strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had\nheard
    of the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing to\nencounter the perils
    of his jaw.\n  But there were still other and more vital practical influences
    at\nwork. Nor even at the present day has the original prestige of the\nSperm
    Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of\nthe leviathan, died
    out of the minds of the whalemen as a body.\nThere are those this day among them,
    who, though intelligent and\ncourageous enough in offering battle to the Greenland
    or Right\nwhale, would perhaps- either from professional inexperience, or\nincompetency,
    or timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale;\nat any rate, there are
    plenty of whalemen, especially among those\nwhaling nations not sailing under
    the American flag, who have never\nhostilely encountered the Sperm Whale, but
    whose sole knowledge of the\nleviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively
    pursued\nin the North; seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a\nchildish
    fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of\nSouthern whaling. Nor
    is the preeminent tremendousness of the great\nSperm Whale anywhere more feelingly
    comprehended, than on board of\nthose prows which stem him.\n  And as if the
    now tested reality of his might had in former\nlegendary times thrown its shadow
    before it; we find some book\nnaturalists- Olassen and Povelson- declaring the
    Sperm Whale not\nonly to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea,
    but\nalso to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for\nhuman
    blood. Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier's, were these\nor almost similar
    impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the\nBaron himself affirms that
    at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish\n(sharks included) are \"struck with the
    most lively terrors,\" and\n\"often in the precipitancy of their flight dash
    themselves against the\nrocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death.\"
    And however\nthe general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as\nthese;
    yet in their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item\nof Povelson, the
    superstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes\nof their vocation, revived
    in the minds of the hunters.\n  So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning
    him, not a\nfew of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the\nearlier
    days of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard\nto induce long
    practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of\nthis new and daring warfare;
    such men protesting that although other\nleviathans might be hopefully pursued,
    yet to chase and point lances\nat such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not
    for mortal man.\nThat to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick\neternity.
    On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may\nbe consulted.\n 
    Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these\nthings were ready
    to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater\nnumber who, chancing only to
    hear of him distantly and vaguely,\nwithout the specific details of any certain
    calamity, and without\nsuperstitious accompaniments were sufficiently hardy not
    to flee\nfrom the battle if offered.\n  One of the wild suggestions referred
    to, as at last coming to be\nlinked with the White Whale in the minds of the
    superstitiously\ninclined, was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous;\nthat
    he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and\nthe same instant
    of time.\n  Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit\naltogether
    without some faint show of superstitious probability. For\nas the secrets of
    the currents in the seas have never yet been\ndivulged, even to the most erudite
    research; so the hidden ways of the\nSperm Whale when beneath the surface remain,
    in great part,\nunaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have originated\nthe
    most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them,\nespecially concerning
    the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a\ngreat depth, he transports himself
    with such vast swiftness to the\nmost widely distant points.\n  It is a thing
    well known to both American and English whale-ships,\nand as well a thing placed
    upon authoritative record years ago by\nScoresby, that some whales have been
    captured far north in the\nPacific, in whose bodies have been found the barbs
    of harpoons\ndarted in the Greenland seas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in
    some\nof these instances it has been declared that the interval of time\nbetween
    the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days.\nHence, by inference,
    it has been believed by some whalemen, that the\nNor' West Passage, so long a
    problem to man, was never a problem to\nthe whale. So that here, in the real
    living experience of living\nmen, the prodigies related in old times of the inland
    Strello mountain\nin Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in
    which the\nwrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still more\nwonderful
    story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose waters\nwere believed to
    have come from the Holy Land by an underground\npassage); these fabulous narrations
    are almost fully equalled by the\nrealities of the whalemen.\n  Forced into familiarity,
    then, with such prodigies as these; and\nknowing that after repeated, intrepid
    assaults, the White Whale had\nescaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise
    that some whalemen\nshould go still further in their superstitions; declaring
    Moby Dick\nnot only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity\nin
    time); that though groves of spears should be planted in his\nflanks, he would
    still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever\nbe made to spout thick
    blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly\ndeception; for again in unensanguined
    billows hundreds of leagues\naway, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.\n 
    But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough\nin the
    earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to\nstrike the imagination
    with unwonted power. For, it was not so much\nhis uncommon bulk that so much
    distinguished him from other sperm\nwhales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out-
    a peculiar snow-white\nwrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump.
    These were\nhis prominent features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless,\nuncharted
    seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those\nwho knew him.\n 
    The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled\nwith the same
    shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his\ndistinctive appellation of
    the White Whale; a name, indeed,\nliterally justified by his vivid aspect, when
    seen gliding at high\nnoon through a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake
    of creamy foam,\nall spangled with golden gleamings.\n  Nor was it his unwonted
    magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet\nhis deformed lower jaw, that so much
    invested the whale with natural\nterror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity
    which, according\nto specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in
    his\nassaults. More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of\ndismay
    than perhaps aught else. For, when swimming before his exulting\npursuers, with
    every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times\nbeen known to turn round
    suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either\nstave their boats to splinters,
    or drive them back in consternation to\ntheir ship.\n  Already several fatalities
    had attended his chase. But though\nsimilar disasters, however little bruited
    ashore, were by no means\nunusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such
    seemed the\nWhite Whale's infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every\ndismembering
    or death that he caused, was not wholly regarded as\nhaving been inflicted by
    an unintelligent agent.\n  Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted
    fury the\nminds of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips\nof
    chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out\nof the white
    curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene,\nexasperating sunlight, that
    smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.\n  His three boats stove around him,
    and oars and men both whirling\nin the eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife
    from his broken\nprow, had dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his
    foe,\nblindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of\nthe
    whale. That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly\nsweeping his sickle-shaped
    lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped\naway Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade
    of grass in the field. No turbaned\nTurk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have
    smote him with more\nseeming malice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that
    ever since\nthat almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild\nvindictiveness
    against the whale, all the more fell for that in his\nfrantic morbidness he at
    last came to identify with him, not only\nall his bodily woes, but all his intellectual
    and spiritual\nexasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac\nincarnation
    of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel\neating in them, till
    they are left living on with half a heart and\nhalf a lung. That intangible malignity
    which has been from the\nbeginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians
    ascribe\none-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east\nreverenced
    in their statue devil;- Ahab did not fall down and\nworship it like them; but
    deliriously transferring its idea to the\nabhorred white whale, he pitted himself,
    all mutilated, against it.\nAll that most maddens and torments; all that stirs
    up the lees of\nthings; all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews
    and\ncakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all\nevil,
    to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically\nassailable in
    Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale's white hump the\nsum of all the general rage
    and hate felt by his whole race from\nAdam down; and then, as if his chest had
    been a mortar, he burst his\nhot heart's shell upon it.\n  It is not probable
    that this monomania in him took its instant\nrise at the precise time of his
    bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting\nat the monster, knife in hand, he had
    but given loose to a sudden,\npassionate, corporal animosity; and when he received
    the stroke that\ntore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration,
    but\nnothing more. Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home,\nand
    for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay\nstretched together in
    one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary,\nhowling Patagonian Cape; then
    it was, that his torn body and gashed\nsoul bled into one another; and so interfusing,
    made him mad. That\nit was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter,
    that\nthe final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from the fact\nthat,
    at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and,\nthough unlimbed
    of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his\nEgyptian chest, and was
    moreover intensified by his delirium, that his\nmates were forced to lace him
    fast, even there, as he sailed, raving\nin his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he
    swung to the mad rockings of\nthe gales. And, when running into more sufferable
    latitudes, the ship,\nwith mild stun'sails spread, floated across the tranquil
    tropics, and,\nto all appearances, the old man's delirium seemed left behind
    him with\nthe Cape Horn swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the\nblessed
    light and air; even then, when he bore that firm, collected\nfront, however pale,
    and issued his calm orders once again; and his\nmates thanked God the direful
    madness was now gone; even then, Ahab,\nin his hidden self, raved on. Human madness
    is oftentimes a cunning\nand most feline thing. When you think it fled, it may
    have but\nbecome transfigured into some still subtler form. Ahab's full lunacy\nsubsided
    not, but deepeningly contracted; like the unabated Hudson,\nwhen that noble Northman
    flows narrowly, but unfathomably through\nthe Highland gorge. But, as in his
    narrow-flowing monomania, not one\njot of Ahab's broad madness had been left
    behind; so in that broad\nmadness, not one jot of his great natural intellect
    had perished. That\nbefore living agent, now became the living instrument. If
    such a\nfurious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general\nsanity,
    and carried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon\nits own mad mark;
    so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab,\nto that one end, did now possess
    a thousand fold more potency than\never he had sanely brought to bear upon any
    one reasonable object.\n  This is much; yet Ahab's larger, darker, deeper part
    remains\nunhinted. But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is\nprofound.
    Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked\nHotel de Cluny where
    we here stand- however grand and wonderful, now\nquit it;- and take your way,
    ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast\nRoman halls of Thermes; where far beneath
    the fantastic towers of\nman's upper earth, his root of grandeur, his whole awful
    essence\nsits in bearded state; an antique buried beneath antiquities, and\nthroned
    on torsoes! So with a broken throne, the great gods mock\nthat captive king;
    so like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on\nhis frozen brow the piled
    entablatures of ages. Wind ye down there, ye\nprouder, sadder souls! question
    that proud, sad king! A family\nlikeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled
    royalties; and from\nyour grim sire only will the old State-secret come.\n  Now,
    in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely; all my\nmeans are sane,
    my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to\nkill, or change, or shun the
    fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he\ndid long dissemble; in some sort,
    did still. But that thing of his\ndissembling was only subject to his perceptibility,
    not to his will\ndeterminate. Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling,\nthat
    when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer\nthought him otherwise
    than but naturally grieved, and that to the\nquick, with the terrible casualty
    which had overtaken him.\n  The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was
    likewise\npopularly ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added\nmoodiness
    which always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the\nPequod on the present
    voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so\nvery unlikely, that far from
    distrusting his fitness for another\nwhaling voyage, on account of such dark
    symptoms, the calculating\npeople of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor
    the conceit,\nthat for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and
    set on\nedge, for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of\nwhales.
    Gnawed within and scorched without, with the infixed,\nunrelenting fangs of some
    incurable idea; such an one, could he be\nfound, would seem the very man to dart
    his iron and lift his lance\nagainst the most appalling of all brutes. Or, if
    for any reason\nthought to be corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an
    one\nwould seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings\nto
    the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the\nmad secret
    of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had\npurposely sailed upon
    the present voyage with the one only and\nall-engrossing object of hunting the
    White Whale. Had any one of his\nold acquaintances on shore but half dreamed
    of what was lurking in him\nthen, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls
    have wrenched\nthe ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on profitable\ncruises,
    the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint. He\nwas intent on an
    audacious, immitigable, and supernatural revenge.\n  Here, then, was this grey-headed,
    ungodly old man, chasing with\ncurses Job's whale round the world, at the head
    of a crew, too,\nchiefly made up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals-\nmorally
    enfeebled also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue\nor right-mindedness
    in Starbuck, the invunerable jollity of\nindifference and recklessness in Stubb,
    and the pervading mediocrity\nin Flask. Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially
    picked and\npacked by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac\nrevenge.
    How it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old\nman's ire- by what
    evil magic their souls were possessed, that at\ntimes his hate seemed almost
    theirs; the White Whale as much their\ninsufferable foe as his; how all this
    came to be- what the White Whale\nwas to them, or how to their unconscious understandings,
    also, in some\ndim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding great demon\nof
    the seas of life,- all this to explain, would be to dive deeper\nthan Ishmael
    can go. The subterranean miner that works in us all,\nhow can one tell whither
    leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled\nsound of his pick? Who does not
    feel the irresistible arm drag? What\nskiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand
    still? For one, I gave myself\nup to the abandonment of the time and the place;
    but while yet all\na-rush to encounter the whale, could see naught in that brute
    but\nthe deadliest ill.\n  "
