  content: "\n  I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under\nmy
    arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good\ncity of old
    Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday\nnight in December.
    Much was I disappointed upon learning that the\nlittle packet for Nantucket had
    already sailed, and that no way of\nreaching that place would offer, till the
    following Monday.\n  As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of
    whaling stop\nat this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it
    may\nas well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my\nmind
    was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because\nthere was a
    fine, boisterous something about everything connected with\nthat famous old island,
    which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New\nBedford has of late been gradually
    monopolizing the business of\nwhaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket
    is now much\nbehind her, yet Nantucket was her great original- the Tyre of this\nCarthage;-
    the place where the first dead American whale was stranded.\nWhere else but from
    Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen, the\nRed-Men, first sally out in canoes
    to give chase to the Leviathan? And\nwhere but from Nantucket, too, did that
    first adventurous little sloop\nput forth, partly laden with imported cobblestones-
    so goes the story-\nto throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were
    nigh\nenough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?\n  Now having a night, a day,
    and still another night following\nbefore me in New Bedford, ere could embark
    for my destined port, it\nbecame a matter of concernment where I was to eat and
    sleep meanwhile.\nIt was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal
    night,\nbitingly cold and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With\nanxious
    grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few\npieces of silver,-
    So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself,\nas I stood in the middle of
    a dreary street shouldering my bag, and\ncomparing the towards the north with
    the darkness towards the south-\nwherever in your wisdom you may conclude to
    lodge for the night, my\ndear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don't
    be too\nparticular.\n  With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the
    sign of\n\"The Crossed Harpoons\"- but it looked too expensive and jolly there.\nFurther
    on, from the bright red windows of the \"Sword-Fish Inn,\" there\ncame such fervent
    rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed\nsnow and ice from before the
    house, for everywhere else the\ncongealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard,
    asphaltic pavement,-\nrather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the
    flinty\nprojections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles of my\nboots
    were in a most miserable plight. Too expensive and jolly,\nagain thought I, pausing
    one moment to watch the broad glare in the\nstreet, and hear the sounds of the
    tinkling glasses within. But go on,\nIshmael, said I at last; don't you hear?
    get away from before the\ndoor; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on
    I went. I now\nby instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there,\ndoubtless,
    were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.\n  Such dreary streets! blocks
    of blackness, not houses, on either\nhand, and here and there a candle, like
    a candle moving about in a\ntomb. At this hour of the night, of the last day
    of the week, that\nquarter of the town proved all but deserted. But presently
    I came to a\nsmoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which\nstood
    invitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for\nthe uses of
    the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to\nstumble over an ash-box
    in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying\nparticles almost choked me, are
    these ashes from that destroyed\ncity, Gomorrah? But \"The Crossed Harpoons,\"
    and the \"The Sword-Fish?\"-\nthis, then must needs be the sign of \"The Trap.\"
    However, I picked\nmyself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened
    a\nsecond, interior door.\n  It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in
    Tophet. A hundred\nblack faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond,
    a black\nAngel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church;\nand
    the preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness, and the\nweeping and
    wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I,\nbacking out, Wretched
    entertainment at the sign of 'The Trap!'\n  Moving on, I at last came to a dim
    sort of light not far from the\ndocks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air;
    and looking up, saw\na swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon
    it, faintly\nrepresenting tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words\nunderneath-
    \"The Spouter Inn:- Peter Coffin.\"\n  Coffin?- Spouter?- Rather ominous in that
    particular connexion,\nthought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they
    say, and I\nsuppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked\nso
    dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the\ndilapidated little
    wooden house itself looked as if it might have been\ncarted here from the ruins
    of some burnt district, and as the swinging\nsign had a poverty-stricken sort
    of creak to it, I thought that here\nwas the very spot for cheap lodgings, and
    the best of pea coffee.\n  It was a queer sort of place- a gable-ended old house,
    one side\npalsied as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp\nbleak
    corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse\nhowling than
    ever it did about poor Paul's tossed craft. Euroclydon,\nnevertheless, is a mighty
    pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with\nhis feet on the hob quietly toasting
    for bed. \"In of that\ntempestuous wind called Euroclydon,\" says an old writer-
    of whose\nworks I possess the only copy extant- \"it maketh a marvellous\ndifference,
    whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where\nthe frost is all on
    the outside, or whether thou observest it from\nthat sashless window, where the
    frost is on both sides, and of which\nthe wight Death is the only glazier.\"
    True enough, thought I, as\nthis passage occurred to my mind- old black-letter,
    thou reasonest\nwell. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the
    house.\nWhat a pity they didn't stop up the chinks and the crannies though,\nand
    thrust in a little lint here and there. But it's too late to\nmake any improvements
    now. The universe is finished; the copestone\nis on, and the chips were carted
    off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus\nthere, chattering his teeth against the
    curbstone for his pillow,\nand shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he
    might plug up both\nears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet
    that\nwould not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old\nDives,
    in his red silken wrapper- (he had a redder one afterwards)\npooh, pooh! What
    a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what\nnorthern lights! Let them talk
    of their oriental summer climes of\neverlasting conservatories; give me the privilege
    of making my own\nsummer with my own coals.\n  But what thinks Lazarus? Can he
    warm his blue hands by holding\nthem up to the grand northern lights? Would not
    Lazarus rather be in\nSumatra than here? Would he not far rather lay him down
    lengthwise\nalong the line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery\npit
    itself, in order to keep out this frost?\n  Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded
    there on the curbstone\nbefore the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than
    that an\niceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself,
    he\ntoo lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being\na
    president of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of\norphans.\n 
    But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and\nthere is plenty
    of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our\nfrosted feet, and see what
    sort of a place this \"Spouter\" may be.\n  "
