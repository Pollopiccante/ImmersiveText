  content: "\n                   HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS\n  (Foresail rises and discovers
    the watch standing, lounging, leaning,\nand lying in various attitudes, all singing
    in chorus.)\n\n          Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies!\n         
    Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain!\n                   Our captain's
    commanded.-\n\n                    1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR\n  Oh, boys, don't be
    sentimental. it's bad for the digestion! Take a\ntonic, follow me! (Sings, and
    all follow)\n           Our captain stood upon the deck,\n             A spy-glass
    in his hand,\n           A viewing of those gallant whales\n             That
    blew at every strand.\n           Oh, your tubs in your boats, my boys,\n            
    And by your braces stand,\n           And we'll have one of those fine whales,\n            
    Hand, boys, over hand!\n      So, be cheery, my lads! may your hearts never fail!\n     
    While the bold harpooneer is striking the whale!\n\n              MATE'S VOICE
    FROM THE QUARTER-DECK\n  Eight bells there, forward!\n\n                    
    2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR\n  Avast the chorus! Eight bells there! d'ye hear, bell-boy?
    Strike the\nbell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me call the watch.\nI've
    the sort of mouth for that- the hogshead mouth. So, so,\n(thrusts his head down
    the scuttle,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y! Eight\nbells there below! Tumble up!\n\n                      
    DUTCH SAILOR\n  Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark this
    in\nour old Mogul's wine; it's quite as deadening to some as filliping\nto others.
    We sing; they sleep- aye, lie down there, like\nground-tier butts. At 'em again!
    There, take this copper-pump, and\nhail 'em through it. Tell 'em to avast dreaming
    of their lassies. Tell\n'em it's the resurrection; they must kiss their last,
    and come to\njudgment. That's the way- that's it; thy throat ain't spoiled with\neating
    Amsterdam butter.\n\n                       FRENCH SAILOR\n  Hist, boys! let's
    have a jig or two before we ride to anchor in\nBlanket Bay. What say ye? There
    comes the other watch. Stand by all\nlegs! Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your
    tambourine!\n\n                   PIP (Sulky and sleepy)\n  Don't know where
    it is.\n\n                       FRENCH SAILOR\n  Beat thy belly, then, and wag
    thy ears. Jig it, men, I say;\nmerry's the word; hurrah! Damn me, won't you dance?
    Form, now,\nIndian-file, and gallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves!\nLegs!
    legs!\n\n                       ICELAND SAILOR\n  I don't like your floor, maty;
    it's too springy to my taste. I'm\nused to ice-floors. I'm sorry to throw cold
    water on the subject;\nbut excuse me.\n\n                       MALTESE SAILOR\n 
    Me too; where's your girls? Who but a fool would take his left\nhand by his right,
    and say to himself, how d'ye do? Partners! I must\nhave partners!\n\n                      
    SICILIAN SAILOR\n  Aye; girls and a green!- then I'll hop with ye; yea, turn\ngrasshopper!\n\n                     
    LONG-ISLAND SAILOR\n  Well, well, ye sulkies, there's plenty more of us. Hoe
    corn when you\nmay, say I. All legs go to harvest soon. Ah! here comes the music;
    now\nfor it!\n\nAZORE SAILOR (Ascending, and pitching the tambourine up the scuttle.)\n 
    Here you are, Pip; and there's the windlass-bits; up you mount! Now,\nboys!\n 
    (The half of them dance to the tambourine; some go below; some sleep\nor lie
    among the coils of rigging. Oaths a-plenty.)\n\n                    AZORE SAILOR
    (Dancing)\n  Go it, Pip! Bang it, bell-boy! Rig it, dig it, stig it, quig it,\nbell-boy!
    Make fire-flies; break the jinglers!\n\n                             PIP\n  Jinglers,
    you say?- there goes another, dropped off; I pound it so.\n\n                         
    CHINA SAILOR\n  Rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of thyself.\n\n\n                         
    FRENCH SAILOR\n  Merry-mad! Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through it! Split\njibs!
    tear yourself!\n\n                    TASHTEGO (Quietly smoking)\n  That's a
    white man; he calls that fun: humph! I save my sweat.\n\n                        
    OLD MANX SAILOR\n  I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what they
    are\ndancing over. I'll dance over your grave, I will- that's the bitterest\nthreat
    of your night-women, that beat head-winds round corners. O\nChrist! to think
    of the green navies and the green-skulled crews!\nWell, well; belike the whole
    world's a ball, as you scholars have\nit; and so 'tis right to make one ballroom
    of it. Dance on, lads,\nyou're young; I was once.\n\n                       3D
    NANTUCKET SAILOR\n  Spell oh!- whew! this is worse than pulling after whales
    in a\ncalm- give a whiff, Tash.\n  (They cease dancing, and gather in clusters.
    Meantime the sky\ndarkens- the wind rises.)\n\n                          LASCAR
    SAILOR\n  By Brahma! boys, it'll be douse sail soon. The sky-born, high-tide\nGanges
    turned to wind! Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!\n\n          MALTESE SAILOR
    (Reclining and shaking his cap)\n  It's the waves- the snow's caps turn to jig
    it now. They'll shake\ntheir tassels soon. Now would all the waves were women,
    then I'd go\ndrown, and chassee with them evermore! There's naught so sweet on\nearth-
    heaven may not match it!- as those swift glances of warm,\nwild bosoms in the
    dance, when the over-arboring arms hide such\nripe, bursting grapes.\n\n                   
    SICILIAN SAILOR (Reclining)\n  Tell me not of it! Hark ye, lad- fleet interlacings
    of the limbs-\nlithe swayings- coyings- flutterings! lip! heart! hip! all graze:\nunceasing
    touch and go! not taste, observe ye, else come satiety.\nEh, Pagan? (Nudging.)\n\n                
    TAHITAN SAILOR (Reclining on a mat)\n  Hail, holy nakedness of our dancing girls!-
    the Heeva-Heeva! Ah! low\nveiled, high palmed Tahiti! I still rest me on thy
    mat, but the soft\nsoil has slid! I saw thee woven in the wood, my mat! green
    the first\nday I brought ye thence; now worn and wilted quite. Ah me!- not thou\nnor
    I can bear the change! How then, if so be transplanted to yon sky?\nHear I the
    roaring streams from Pirohitee's peak of spears, when\nthey leap down the crags
    and drown the villages?- The blast, the\nblast! Up, spine, and meet it! (Leaps
    to his feet.)\n\n                        PORTUGUESE SAILOR\n  How the sea rolls
    swashing 'gainst the side! Stand by for reefing,\nhearties! the winds are just
    crossing swords, pell-mell they'll go\nlunging presently.\n\n                         
    DANISH SAILOR\n  Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou holdest!
    Well\ndone! The mate there holds ye to it stiffly. He's no more afraid\nthan
    the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic with\nstorm-lashed guns,
    on which the sea-salt cakes!\n\n                       4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR\n 
    He has his orders, mind ye that. I heard old Ahab tell him he must\nalways kill
    a squall, something as they burst a waterspout with a\npistol- fire your ship
    right into it!\n\n                          ENGLISH SAILOR\n  Blood! but that
    old man's a grand old cove! We are the lads to\nhunt him up his whale!\n\n                            
    ALL\n  Aye! aye!\n\n                       OLD MANX SAILOR\n  How the three pines
    shake! Pines are the hardest sort of tree to\nlive when shifted to any other
    soil, and here there's none but the\ncrew's cursed clay. Steady, helmsman! steady.
    This is the sort of\nweather when brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls
    split at\nsea. Our captain has his birthmark; look yonder, boys, there's another\nin
    the sky lurid- like, ye see, all else pitch black.\n\n                           
    DAGGOO\n  What of that? Who's afraid of black's afraid of me! I'm quarried out\nof
    it!\n\n                         SPANISH SAILOR\n  (Aside.) He wants to bully,
    ah!- the old grudge makes me touchy\n(Advancing.) Aye, harpooneer, thy race is
    the undeniable dark side\nof mankind- devilish dark at that. No offence.\n\n                         
    DAGGOO (Grimly)\n  None.\n\n                        ST. JAGO'S SAILOR\n  That
    Spaniard's mad or drunk. But that can't be, or else in his\none case our old
    Mogul's fire-waters are somewhat long in working.\n\n                       5TH
    NANTUCKET SAILOR\n  What's that I saw- lightning? Yes.\n\n                          
    SPANISH SAILOR\n  No; Daggoo showing his teeth.\n\n                         DAGGOO
    (Springing)\n  Swallow thine, mannikin! White skin, white liver!\n\n                   
    SPANISH SAILOR (Meeting him)\n  Knife thee heartily! big frame, small spirit!\n\n                              
    ALL\n  A row! a row! a row!\n\n                     TASHTEGO (With a whiff)\n 
    A row a'low, and a row aloft- Gods and men- both brawlers! Humph!\n\n                        
    BELFAST SAILOR\n  A row! arrah a row! The Virgin be blessed, a row! Plunge in
    with ye!\n\n                          ENGLISH SAILOR\n  Fair play! Snatch the
    Spaniard's knife! A ring, a ring!\n\n                          OLD MANX SAILOR\n 
    Ready formed. There! the ringed horizon. In that ring Cain struck\nAbel. Sweet
    work, right work! No? Why then, God, mad'st thou the ring?\n\n               
    MATE'S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK\n  Hands by the halyards! in top-gallant sails!
    Stand by to reef\ntopsails!\n\n                               ALL\n  The squall!
    the squall! jump, my jollies! (They scatter.)\n\n\n                PIP (Shrinking
    under the windlass)\n  Jollies? Lord help such jollies! Crish, crash! there goes
    the\njib-stay! Blang-whang! God! Duck lower, Pip, here comes the royal\nyard!
    It's worse than being in the whirled woods, the last day of\nthe year! Who'd
    go climbing after chestnuts now? But there they go,\nall cursing, and here I
    don't. Fine prospects to 'em; they're on the\nroad to heaven. Hold on hard! Jimmini,
    what a squall! But those\nchaps there are worse yet- they are your white squalls,
    they. White\nsqualls? white whale, shirr! shirr! Here have I heard all their
    chat\njust now, and the white whale- shirr! shirr!- but spoken of once!\nand
    only this evening- it makes me ingle all over like my\ntambourine- that anaconda
    of an old man swore 'em in to hunt him!\nOh! thou big white God aloft there somewhere
    in yon darkness, have\nmercy on this small black boy down here; preserve him
    from all men\nthat have no bowels to feel fear!\n  "
