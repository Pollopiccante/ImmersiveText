  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 100,   Leg and Arm
  content: "\n  Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a\nplace
    as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on\nship-board, arising from
    the existence of the harpooneer class of\nofficers, a class unknown of course
    in any other marine than the\nwhale-fleet.\n  The large importance attached to
    the harpooneer's vocation is\nevinced by the fact, that originally in the old
    Dutch Fishery, two\ncenturies and more ago, the command of a whale-ship was not
    wholly\nlodged in the person now called the captain, but was divided between\nhim
    and an officer called the Specksynder. Literally this word means\nFat-Cutter;
    usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief\nHarpooneer. In those days,
    the captain's authority was restricted to\nthe navigation and general management
    of the vessel; while over the\nwhale-hunting department and all its concerns,
    the Specksynder or\nChief Harpooneer reigned supreme. In the British Greenland
    Fishery,\nunder the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official\nis
    still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged. At\npresent he ranks
    simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but\none of the captain's more inferior
    subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon\nthe good conduct of the harpooneers the success
    of a whaling voyage\nlargely depends, and since in the American Fishery he is
    not only an\nimportant officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances\n(night
    watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship's deck\nis also his; therefore
    the grand political maxim of the sea demands,\nthat he should nominally live
    apart from the men before the mast,\nand be in some way distinguished as their
    professional superior;\nthough always, by them, familiarly regarded as their
    social equal.\n  Now, the grand distinction between officer and man at sea, is\nthis-
    the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and\nmerchantmen
    alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and\nso, too, in most
    of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in\nthe after part of the
    ship. That is to say, they take their meals in\nthe captain's cabin, and sleep
    in a place indirectly communicating\nwith it.\n  Though the long period of a
    Southern whaling voyage (by far the\nlongest of all voyages now or ever made
    by man), the peculiar perils\nof it, and the community of interest prevailing
    among a company, all\nof whom, high or low, depend for their profits, not upon
    fixed\nwages, but upon their common luck, together with their common\nvigilance,
    intrepidity, and hard work; though all these things do in\nsome cases tend to
    beget a less rigorous discipline than in\nmerchantmen generally; yet, never mind
    how much like an old\nMesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some primitive
    instances,\nlive together; for all that, the punctilious externals, at least,
    of\nthe quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance\ndone
    away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in which you will\nsee the skipper
    parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur\nnot surpassed in any military
    navy; nay, extorting almost as much\noutward homage as if he wore the imperial
    purple, and not the\nshabbiest of pilot-cloth.\n  And though of all men the moody
    captain of the Pequod was the\nleast given to that sort of shallowest assumption;
    and though the only\nhomage he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience;\nthough
    he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere\nstepping upon the quarter-deck;
    and though there were times when,\nowing to peculiar circumstances connected
    with events hereafter to\nbe detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms, whether
    of\ncondescension or in terrorem, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab\nwas by
    no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the\nsea.\n  Nor, perhaps,
    will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind\nthose forms and usages,
    as it were, he sometimes masked himself;\nincidentally making use of them for
    other and more private ends than\nthey were legitimately intended to subserve.
    That certain sultanism of\nhis brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained
    unmanifested;\nthrough those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an\nirresistible
    dictatorship. For be a man's intellectual superiority\nwhat it will, it can never
    assume the practical, available supremacy\nover other men, without the aid of
    some sort of external arts and\nentrenchments, always, in themselves, more or
    less paltry and base.\nThis it is, that for ever keeps God's true princes of
    the Empire\nfrom the world's hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this
    air\ncan give, to those men who become famous more through their infinite\ninferiority
    to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than\nthrough their undoubted
    superiority over the dead level of the mass.\nSuch large virtue lurks in these
    small things when extreme political\nsuperstitions invest them, that in some
    royal instances even to\nidiot imbecility they have imparted potency. But when,
    as in the\ncase of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire\nencircles
    an imperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased\nbefore the tremendous
    centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist\nwho would depict mortal indomitableness
    in its fullest sweep and\ndirect swing, ever forget a hint, incidentally so important
    in his\nart, as the one now alluded to.\n  But Ahab, my Captain, still moves
    before me in all his Nantucket\ngrimness and shagginess; and in this episode
    touching Emperors and\nKings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with
    a poor old\nwhale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical\ntrappings
    and housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in\nthee, it must needs
    be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in the\ndeep, and featured in the
    unbodied air!\n  "
