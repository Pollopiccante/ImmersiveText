  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 19,   The Prophet
  content: "\n  If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so\noutlandish
    an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite\nsociety of a civilized
    town, that astonishment soon departed upon\ntaking my first daylight stroll through
    the streets of New Bedford.\n  In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable
    seaport will\nfrequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from\nforeign
    parts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean\nmariners will sometimes
    jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is\nnot unknown to Lascars and Malays;
    and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green,\nlive Yankees have often scared the natives.
    But New Bedford beats\nall Water Street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned
    haunts you see\nonly sailors; in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting
    at\nstreet corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their\nbones
    unholy flesh. It makes a stranger stare.\n  But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs,
    Erromanggoans,\nPannangians, and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens
    of the\nwhaling-craft which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see\nother
    sights still more curious, certainly more comical. There\nweekly arrive in this
    town scores of green Vermonters and New\nHampshire men, all athirst for gain
    and glory in the fishery. They are\nmostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows
    who have felled forests, and\nnow seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance.
    Many are as green\nas the Green Mountains whence they came. In some things you
    would\nthink them but a few hours old. Look there! that chap strutting\nround
    the corner. He wears a beaver hat and swallow-tailed coat,\ngirdled with a sailor-belt
    and a sheath-knife. Here comes another with\na sou'-wester and a bombazine cloak.\n 
    No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one- I mean a\ndownright
    bumpkin dandy- a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow\nhis two acres in buckskin
    gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now\nwhen a country dandy like this takes
    it into his head to make a\ndistinguished reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery,
    you\nshould see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport. In\nbespeaking
    his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats;\nstraps to his canvas
    trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will\nburst those straps in the first
    howling gale, when thou art driven,\nstraps, buttons, and all, down the throat
    of the tempest.\n  But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers,
    cannibals,\nand bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford
    is\na queer place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land\nwould
    this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the\ncoast of Labrador.
    As it is, parts of her back country are enough to\nfrighten one, they look so
    bony. The town itself is perhaps the\ndearest place to live in, in all New England.
    It is a land of oil,\ntrue enough: but not like Canaan; a land, also, of corn
    and wine.\nThe streets do not run with milk; nor in the spring-time do they\npave
    them with fresh eggs. Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all\nAmerica will you
    find more patrician-like houses; parks and gardens\nmore opulent, than in New
    Bedford. Whence came they? how planted\nupon this once scraggy scoria of a country?\n 
    Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty\nmansion,
    and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave\nhouses and flowery
    gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian\noceans. One and all, they
    were harpooned and dragged up hither from\nthe bottom of the sea. Can Herr Alexander
    perform a feat like that?\n  In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for
    dowers to their\ndaughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises\na-piece.
    You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for,\nthey say, they have
    reservoirs of oil in every house, and every\nnight recklessly burn their lengths
    in spermaceti candles.\n  In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine
    maples-\nlong avenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the\nbeautiful
    and bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer\nthe passer-by their
    tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So\nomnipotent is art; which
    in many a district of New Bedford has\nsuperinduced bright terraces ot flowers
    upon the barren refuse rocks\nthrown aside at creation's final day.\n  And the
    women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses.\nBut roses only bloom
    in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their\ncheeks is perennial as sunlight
    in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere\nmatch that bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save
    in Salem, where they\ntell me the young girls breathe such musk, their sailor
    sweethearts\nsmell them miles off shore, as though they were drawing nigh the\nodorous
    Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands.\n  "
