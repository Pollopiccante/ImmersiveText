  content: "\n  By the Mainmast; Starbuck leaning against it.\n\n  My soul is more
    than matched; she's over-manned; and by a madman!\nInsufferable sting, that sanity
    should ground arms on such a field!\nBut he drilled deep down, and blasted all
    my reason out of me! I think\nI see his impious end; but feel that I must help
    him to it. Will I,\nnill I, the ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with
    a cable I\nhave no knife to cut. Horrible old man! Who's over him, he cries;-\naye,
    he would be a democrat to all above; look, how he lords it over\nall below! Oh!
    I plainly see my miserable office,- to obey, rebelling;\nand worse yet, to hate
    with touch of pity! For in his eyes I read some\nlurid woe would shrivel me up,
    had I it. Yet is there hope. Time and\ntide flow wide. The hated whale has the
    round watery world to swim in,\nas the small gold-fish has its glassy globe.
    His heaven-insulting\npurpose, God may wedge aside. I would up heart, were it
    not like lead.\nBut my whole clock's run down; my heart the all-controlling weight,\nI
    have no key to lift again.\n\n  [A burst of revelry from the forecastle.]\n\n 
    Oh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of\nhuman mothers
    in them! Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea. The\nwhite whale is their demigorgon.
    Hark! the infernal orgies! that\nrevelry is forward! mark the unfaltering silence
    aft! Methinks it\npictures life. Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on
    the gay,\nembattled, bantering bow, but only to drag dark Ahab after it, where\nhe
    broods within his sternward cabin, builded over the dead water of\nthe wake,
    and further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings. The long\nhowl thrills me through!
    Peace! ye revellers, and set the watch! Oh,\nlife! 'tis in an hour like this,
    with soul beat down and held to\nknowledge,- as wild, untutored things are forced
    to feed- Oh, life!\n'tis now that I do feel the latent horror in thee! but 'tis
    not me!\nthat horror's out of me, and with the soft feeling of the human in me,\nyet
    will I try to fight ye, ye grim, phantom futures! Stand by me,\nhold me, bind
    me, O ye blessed influences!\n  "
