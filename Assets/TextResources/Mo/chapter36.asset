  content: "\n  Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West\nand
    South. It is not down on any map; true places never are.\n  When a new-hatched
    savage running wild about his native woodlands in\na grass clout, followed by
    the nibbling goats, as if he were a green\nsapling; even then, in Queequeg's
    ambitious soul, lurked a strong\ndesire to see something more of Christendom
    than a specimen whaler\nor two. His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle
    a High\nPriest; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives\nof
    unconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins-\nroyal stuff;
    though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity\nhe nourished in his
    untutored youth.\n  A Sag Harbor ship visited his father's bay, and Queequeg
    sought a\npassage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement\nof
    seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father's\ninfluence could
    prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe,\nhe paddled off to a distant
    strait, which he knew the ship must pass\nthrough when she quitted the island.
    On one side was a coral reef;\non the other a low tongue of land, covered with
    mangrove thickets that\ngrew out into the water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat,
    among these\nthickets, with its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle\nlow
    in hand; and when the ship was gliding by, like a flash he\ndarted out; gained
    her side; with one backward dash of his foot\ncapsized and sank his canoe; climbed
    up the chains; and throwing\nhimself at full length upon the deck, grappled a
    ring-bolt there,\nand swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.\n  In
    vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a\ncutlass over
    his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and\nQueequeg budged not. Struck
    by his desperate dauntlessness, and his\nwild desire to visit Christendom, the
    captain at last relented, and\ntold him he might make himself at home. But this
    fine young savage-\nthis sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain's cabin.
    They put\nhim down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like\nCzar
    Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities,\nQueequeg disdained
    no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily\ngain the power of enlightening
    his untutored countrymen. For at\nbottom- so he told me- he was actuated by a
    profound desire to learn\namong the Christians, the arts whereby to make his
    people still\nhappier than they were; and more than that, still better than they\nwere.
    But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that\neven Christians
    could be both miserable and wicked; infinitely more\nso, than all his father's
    heathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor;\nand seeing what the sailors did
    there; and then going on to Nantucket,\nand seeing how they spent their wages
    in that place also, poor\nQueequeg gave it up for lost. Thought he, it's a wicked
    world in all\nmeridians; I'll die a pagan.\n  And thus an old idolator at heart,
    he yet lived among these\nChristians, wore their clothes, and tried to talk their
    gibberish.\nHence the queer ways about him, though now some time from home.\n 
    By hints I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and\nhaving a coronation;
    since he might now consider his father dead and\ngone, he being very old and
    feeble at the last accounts. He answered\nno, not yet; and added that he was
    fearful Christianity, or rather\nChristians, had unfitted him for ascending the
    pure and undefiled\nthrone of thirty pagan Kings before him. But by and by, he
    said, he\nwould return,- as soon as he felt himself baptized again. For the\nnonce,
    however, he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in\nall four oceans.
    They had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed\niron was in lieu of a sceptre
    now.\n  I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future\nmovements.
    He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation.\nUpon this, I told him
    that whaling was my own design, and informed him\nof my intention to sail out
    of Nantucket, as being the most\npromising port for an adventurous whaleman to
    embark from. He at\nonce resolved to accompany me to that island, ship aboard
    the same\nvessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same mess with
    me,\nin short to share my every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly\ndip into
    the Potluck of both worlds. To all this I joyously\nassented; for besides the
    affection I now felt for Queequeg, he was an\nexperienced harpooneer, and as
    such, could not fail to be of great\nusefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly
    ignorant of the\nmysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as
    known to\nmerchant seamen.\n  His story being ended with his pipe's last dying
    puff, Queequeg\nembraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out
    the\nlight, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very\nsoon
    were sleeping.\n  "
