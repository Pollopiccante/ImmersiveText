  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 133,   The Chase - First Day
  content: "\n  Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall\nthat
    took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of\nhis purpose with
    his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in\nthe transom, and bringing
    out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea\ncharts, spread them before him on
    his screwed-down table. Then seating\nhimself before it, you would have seen
    him intently study the\nvarious lines and shadings which there met his eye; and
    with slow\nbut steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before\nwere
    blank. At intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books\nbeside him, wherein
    were set down the seasons and places in which,\non various former voyages of
    various ships, sperm whales had been\ncaptured or seen.\n  While thus employed,
    the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains\nover his head, continually rocked
    with the motion of the ship, and for\never threw shifting gleams and shadows
    of lines upon his wrinkled\nbrow, till it almost seemed that while he himself
    was marking out\nlines and courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil
    was\nalso tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his\nforehead.\n 
    But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his\ncabin,
    Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they\nwere brought out;
    almost every night some pencil marks were effaced,\nand others were substituted.
    For with the charts of all four oceans\nbefore him, Ahab was threading a maze
    of currents and eddies, with a\nview to the more certain accomplishment of that
    monomaniac thought\nof his soul.\n  Now, to any one not fully acquainted with
    the ways of the\nleviathans, it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to
    seek out\none solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not\nso
    did it seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents;\nand thereby
    calculating the driftings of the sperm whale's food;\nand, also calling to mind
    the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting\nhim in particular latitudes; could
    arrive at reasonable surmises,\nalmost approaching to certainties, concerning
    the timeliest day to\nbe upon this or that ground in search of his prey.\n  So
    assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the\nsperm whale's
    resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe\nthat, could he be closely
    observed and studied throughout the world;\nwere the logs for one voyage of the
    entire whale fleet carefully\ncollated, then the migrations of the sperm whale
    would be found to\ncorrespond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals
    or the\nflights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been made to\nconstruct
    elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*\n\n  *Since the above was written,
    the statement is happily borne out\nby an official circular, issued by Lieutenant
    Maury, of the National\nObservatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By that circular,
    it\nappears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and\nportions
    of it are presented in the circular. \"This chart divides\nthe ocean into districts
    of five degrees of latitude by five degrees\nof longitude; perpendicularly through
    each of which districts are\ntwelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally
    through each of\nwhich districts are three lines; one to show the number of days
    that\nhave been spent in each month in every district, and the two others to\nshow
    the number of days in which whales, sperm or right, have been\nseen.\"\n\n  Besides,
    when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another,\nthe sperm whales,
    guided by some infallible instinct- say, rather,\nsecret intelligence from the
    Deity- mostly swim in veins, as they\nare called; continuing their way along
    a given ocean-line with such\nundeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed
    her course, by any\nchart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision. Though,
    in these\ncases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a\nsurveyor's
    parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly\nconfined to its own unavoidable,
    straight wake, yet the arbitrary vein\nin which at these times he is said to
    swim, generally embraces some\nfew miles in width (more or less, as the vein
    is presumed to expand or\ncontract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from
    the whale-ship's\nmast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone.
    The\nsum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and along\nthat path,
    migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for.\n  And hence not only
    at substantiated times, upon well known\nseparate feeding-grounds, could Ahab
    hope to encounter his prey; but\nin crossing the widest expanses of water between
    those grounds he\ncould, by his art, so place and time himself on his way, as
    even\nthen not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting.\n  There was a circumstance
    which at first sight seemed to entangle his\ndelirious but still methodical scheme.
    But not so in the reality,\nperhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have
    their regular seasons\nfor particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude
    that the\nherds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year,\nsay,
    will turn out to be identically the same with those that were\nfound there the
    preceding season; though there are peculiar and\nunquestionable instances where
    the contrary of this has proved true.\nIn general, the same remark, only within
    a less wide limit, applies to\nthe solitaries and hermits among the matured,
    aged sperm whales. So\nthat though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen,
    for example,\non what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or
    Volcano\nBay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow that were the\nPequod
    to visit either of those spots at any subsequent\ncorresponding season, she would
    infallibly encounter him there. So,\ntoo, with some other feeding-grounds, where
    he had at times revealed\nhimself. But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places
    and\nocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode. And\nwhere Ahab's
    chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been\nspoken of, allusion has
    only been made to whatever way-side,\nantecedent, extra prospects were his, ere
    a particular set time or\nplace were attained, when all possibilities would become\nprobabilities,
    and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the next\nthing to a certainty.
    That particular set time and place were\nconjoined in the one technical phrase-
    the Season-on-the-Line. For\nthere and then, for several consecutive years, Moby
    Dick had been\nperiodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as
    the\nsun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any\none sign
    of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of the deadly\nencounters with the
    white whale had taken place; there the waves\nwere storied with his deeds; there
    also was that tragic spot where the\nmonomaniac old man had found the awful motive
    to his vengeance. But in\nthe cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance
    with which\nAhab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he would\nnot
    permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact\nabove mentioned,
    however flattering it might be to those hopes; nor in\nthe sleeplessness of his
    vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet\nheart as to postpone all intervening
    quest.\n  Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of\nthe
    Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her\ncommander to
    make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn,\nand then running down sixty
    degrees of latitude arrive in the\nequatorial Pacific in time to cruise there.
    Therefore, he must wait\nfor the next ensuing season. Yet the premature hour
    of the Pequod's\nsailing had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with
    a view\nto this very complexion of things. Because, an interval of three\nhundred
    and sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval\nwhich, instead of
    impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a\nmiscellaneous hunt; if by chance
    the White Whale, spending his\nvacation in seas far remote from his periodical
    feeding-grounds,\nshould turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in
    the\nBengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.\nSo
    that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor-Westers, Harmattans, Traders; any wind\nbut the Levanter
    and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious\nzig-zag world-circle of the
    Pequod's circumnavigating wake.\n  But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly
    and coolly, seems it\nnot but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean,
    one\nsolitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of\nindividual
    recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded\nMufti in the thronged thoroughfares
    of Constantinople? Yes. For the\npeculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his
    snow-white hump,\ncould not but be unmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale,\nAhab
    would mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till\nlong after midnight
    he would throw himself back in reveries- tallied\nhim, and shall he escape? His
    broad fins are bored, and scalloped\nout like a lost sheep's are! And here, his
    mad mind would run on in\na breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of
    pondering came\nover him! and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover
    his\nstrength. Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man endure who\nis
    consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps with\nclenched hands;
    and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms.\n  Often, when forced from
    his hammock by exhausting and intolerably\nvivid dreams of the night, which,
    resuming his own intense thoughts\nthrough the day, carried them on amid a clashing
    of phrensies, and\nwhirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain,
    till\nthe very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and\nwhen,
    as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him\nheaved his being up
    from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in\nhim, from which forked flames and
    lightnings shot up, and accursed\nfiends beckoned him to leap down among them;
    when this hell in himself\nyawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through
    the ship; and\nwith glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as though\nescaping
    from a bed that was on fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead of\nbeing the unsuppressable
    symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright\nat his own resolve, were but the
    plainest tokens of its intensity.\nFor, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming,
    unappeasedly steadfast\nhunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had gone to
    his hammock, was\nnot the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror
    again. The\nlatter was the eternal, living principle or soul in him; and in sleep,\nbeing
    for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind, which\nat other times
    employed it for its outer vehicle or agent, it\nspontaneously sought escape from
    the scorching contiguity of the\nfrantic thing, of which, for the time, it was
    no longer an integral.\nBut as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the
    soul, therefore\nit must have been that, in Ahab's case, yielding up all his
    thoughts\nand fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose, by its own sheer\ninveteracy
    of will, forced itself against gods and devils into a\nkind of self-assumed,
    independent being of its own. Nay, could\ngrimly live and burn, while the common
    vitality to which it was\nconjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and
    unfathered\nbirth. Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily
    eyes,\nwhen what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the time but a\nvacated
    thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of living light,\nto be sure, but
    without an object to color, and therefore a\nblankness in itself. God help thee,
    old man, thy thoughts have created\na creature in thee; and he whose intense
    thinking thus makes him a\nPrometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever;
    that vulture the\nvery creature he creates.\n  "
