  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 91,   The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud
  content: "\n  When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the\nbulwarks;
    and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a\nsailor of the watch,
    he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also\nhis pipe. Lighting the pipe
    at the binnacle lamp and planting the\nstool on the weather side of the deck,
    he sat and smoked.\n  In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish
    kings\nwere fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How\ncould
    one look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without\nbethinking him
    of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the\nplank, and a king of the sea
    and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.\n  Some moments passed, during which
    the thick vapor came from his\nmouth in quick and constant puffs, which blew
    back again into his\nface. \"How now,\" he soliloquized at last, withdrawing
    the tube,\n\"this smoking no longer soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with\nme
    if thy charm be gone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not\npleasuring-
    aye, and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while;\nto windward, and with
    such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying\nwhale, my final jets were the strongest
    and fullest of trouble. What\nbusiness have I with this pipe? This thing that
    is meant for\nsereneness, to send up mild white vapors among mild white hairs,
    not\namong torn iron-grey locks like mine. I'll smoke no more-\"\n  He tossed
    the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in\nthe waves; the same
    instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking\npipe made. With slouched hat,
    Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.\n  "
