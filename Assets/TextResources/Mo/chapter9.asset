  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 10,   A Bosom Friend
  content: "\n  Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,\nlow,
    straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of\nthe bulwarks
    of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very\nlarge oil painting so thoroughly
    besmoked, and every way defaced, that\nin the unequal crosslights by which you
    viewed it, it was only by\ndiligent study and a series of systematic visits to
    it, and careful\ninquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an\nunderstanding
    of its purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades\nand shadows, that at first
    you almost thought some ambitious young\nartist, in the time of the New England
    hags, had endeavored to\ndelineate chaos bewitched. But by dint of much and earnest\ncontemplation,
    and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by throwing\nopen the little window
    towards the back of the entry, you at last come\nto the conclusion that such
    an idea, however wild, might not be\naltogether unwarranted.\n  But what most
    puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,\nportentous, black mass of something
    hovering in the centre of the\npicture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines
    floating in a\nnameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough
    to\ndrive a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite,\nhalf-attained,
    unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you\nto it, till you involuntarily
    took an oath with yourself to find out\nwhat that marvellous painting meant.
    Ever and anon a bright, but,\nalas, deceptive idea would dart you through.- It's
    the Black Sea in\na midnight gale.- It's the unnatural combat of the four primal\nelements.-
    It's a blasted heath.- It's a Hyperborean winter scene.-\nIt's the breaking-up
    of the icebound stream of Time. But last all\nthese fancies yielded to that one
    portentous something in the\npicture's midst. That once found out, and all the
    rest were plain. But\nstop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic
    fish? even\nthe great leviathan himself?\n  In fact, the artist's design seemed
    this: a final theory of my\nown, partly based upon the aggregated opinions of
    many aged persons\nwith whom I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents
    a\nCape-Horner in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering\nthere
    with its three dismantled masts alone visible; and an\nexasperated whale, purposing
    to spring clean over the craft, is in the\nenormous act of impaling himself upon
    the three mast-heads.\n  The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with
    a\nheathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly\nset with
    glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted\nwith knots of human
    hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast\nhandle sweeping round like the
    segment made in the new-mown grass by a\nlong-armed mower. You shuddered as you
    gazed, and wondered what\nmonstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone
    a\ndeath-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed with\nthese
    were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and\ndeformed. Some were
    storied weapons. With this once long lance, now\nwildly elbowed, fifty years
    ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales\nbetween a sunrise and a sunset. And
    that harpoon- so like a\ncorkscrew now- was flung in Javan seas, and run away
    with by a\nwhale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The original\niron
    entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning\nin the body of
    a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last was found\nimbedded in the hump.\n 
    Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way- cut\nthrough what
    in old times must have been a great central chimney\nwith fireplaces all round-
    you enter the public room. A still\nduskier place is this, with such low ponderous
    beams above, and such\nold wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy
    you trod some\nold craft's cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when
    this\ncorner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long,\nlow,
    shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with\ndusty rarities
    gathered from this wide world's remotest nooks.\nProjecting from the further
    angle of the room stands a dark-looking\nden- the bar- a rude attempt at a right
    whale's head. Be that how it\nmay, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale's
    jaw, so wide,\na coach might almost drive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves,\nranged
    round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of\nswift destruction,
    like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed\nthey called him), bustles a
    little withered old man, who, for their\nmoney, dearly sells the sailors deliriums
    and death.\n  Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though\ntrue
    cylinders without- within, the villanous green goggling glasses\ndeceitfully
    tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians\nrudely pecked into
    the glass, surround these footpads' goblets. Fill\nto this mark, and your charge
    is but a penny; to this a penny more;\nand so on to the full glass- the Cape
    Horn measure, which you may gulp\ndown for a shilling.\n  Upon entering the place
    I found a number of young seamen gathered\nabout a table, examining by a dim
    light divers specimens of\nskrimshander. I sought the landlord, and telling him
    I desired to be\naccommodated with a room, received for answer that his house
    was full-\nnot a bed unoccupied. \"But avast,\" he added, tapping his forehead,\n\"you
    haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer's blanket, have ye? I\ns'pose you
    are goin' a-whalin', so you'd better get used to that\nsort of thing.\"\n  I
    told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I\nshould ever do
    so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be,\nand that if he (the landlord)
    really had no other place for me, and\nthe harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable,
    why rather than wander\nfurther about a strange town on so bitter a night, I
    would put up with\nthe half of any decent man's blanket.\n  \"I thought so. All
    right; take a seat. Supper?- you want supper?\nSupper'll be ready directly.\"\n 
    I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench\non the Battery.
    At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning\nit with his jack-knife,
    stooping over and diligently working away at\nthe space between his legs. He
    was trying his hand at a ship under\nfull sail, but he didn't make much headway,
    I thought.\n  At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\nadjoining
    room. It was cold as Iceland- no fire at all- the landlord\nsaid he couldn't
    afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles,\neach in a winding sheet. We
    were fain to button up our monkey jackets,\nand hold to our lips cups of scalding
    tea with our half frozen\nfingers. But the fare was of the most substantial kind-
    not only\nmeat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for\nsupper!
    One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to\nthese dumplings in
    a most direful manner.\n  \"My boy,\" said the landlord, \"you'll have the nightmare
    to a dead\nsartainty.\"\n  \"Landlord,\" I whispered, \"that aint the harpooneer
    is it?\"\n  \"Oh, no,\" said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, \"the\nharpooneer
    is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he\ndon't- he eats nothing
    but steaks, and he likes 'em rare.\"\n  \"The devil he does,\" says I. \"Where
    is that harpooneer? Is he here?\"\n  \"He'll be here afore long,\" was the answer.\n 
    I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this \"dark\ncomplexioned\"
    harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so\nturned out that we
    should sleep together, he must undress and get into\nbed before I did.\n  Supper
    over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing\nnot what else to
    do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the\nevening as a looker on.\n 
    Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the\nlandlord cried,
    \"That's the Grampus's crew. I seed her reported in the\noffing this morning;
    a three years' voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah,\nboys; now we'll have the latest
    news from the Feegees.\"\n  A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the
    door was flung\nopen, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped
    in\ntheir shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen\ncomforters,
    all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with\nicicles, they seemed an
    eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just\nlanded from their boat, and this
    was the first house they entered.\nNo wonder, then, that they made a straight
    wake for the whale's mouth-\nthe bar- when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there
    officiating, soon\npoured them out brimmers all round. One complained of a bad
    cold in\nhis head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and\nmolasses,
    which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and\ncatarrhs whatsoever, never
    mind of how long standing, or whether\ncaught off the coast of Labrador, or on
    the weather side of an\nice-island.\n  The liquor soon mounted into their heads,
    as it generally does\neven with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and
    they began\ncapering about most obstreperously.\n  I observed, however, that
    one of them held somewhat aloof, and\nthough he seemed desirous not to spoil
    the hilarity of his shipmates\nby his own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained
    from making\nas much noise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since\nthe
    sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate\n(though but a sleeping
    partner one, so far as this narrative is\nconcerned), I will here venture upon
    a little description of him. He\nstood full six feet in height, with noble shoulders,
    and a chest\nlike a coffer-dam. I have seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face\nwas
    deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the\ncontrast; while
    in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some\nreminiscences that did not seem
    to give him much joy. His voice at\nonce announced that he was a Southerner,
    and from his fine stature,\nI thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers
    from the\nAlleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry of his companions\nhad
    mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw\nno more of
    him till he became my comrade on the sea. In a few minutes,\nhowever, he was
    missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some\nreason a huge favorite
    with them, they raised a cry of \"Bulkington!\nBulkington! where's Bulkington?\"
    and darted out of the house in\npursuit of him.\n  It was now about nine o'clock,
    and the room seeming almost\nsupernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began
    to congratulate\nmyself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous
    to the\nentrance of the seamen.\n  No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact,
    you would a good deal\nrather not sleep with your own brother. I don't know how
    it is, but\npeople like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes
    to\nsleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange\ntown,
    and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections\nindefinitely multiply.
    Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a\nsailor should sleep two in a bed,
    more than anybody else; for\nsailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than
    bachelor Kings do\nashore. To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment,
    but you\nhave your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and\nsleep
    in your own skin.\n  The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated\nthe
    thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being\na harpooneer,
    his linen or woolen, as the case might be, would not\nbe of the tidiest, certainly
    none of the finest. I began to twitch all\nover. Besides, it was getting late,
    and my decent harpooneer ought\nto be home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he
    should tumble in upon\nme at midnight- how could I tell from what vile hole he
    had been\ncoming?\n  \"Landlord! I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.-
    I shan't\nsleep with him. I'll try the bench here.\"\n  \"Just as you please;
    I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a\nmattress, and it's a plaguy rough
    board here\"- feeling of the knots\nand notches. \"But wait a bit, Skrimshander;
    I've got a carpenter's\nplane there in the bar- wait, I say, and I'll make ye
    snug enough.\" So\nsaying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief
    first\ndusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while\ngrinning
    like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last\nthe plane-iron came
    bump against an indestructible knot. The\nlandlord was near spraining his wrist,
    and I told him for heaven's\nsake to quit- the bed was soft enough to suit me,
    and I did not know\nhow all the planing in the world could make eider down of
    a pine\nplank. So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and throwing\nthem
    into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went about his\nbusiness,
    and left me in a brown study.\n  I now took the measure of the bench, and found
    that it was a foot\ntoo short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it
    was a foot\ntoo narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches\nhigher
    than the planed one- so there was no yoking them. I then placed\nthe first bench
    lengthwise along the only clear space against the\nwall, leaving a little interval
    between, for my back to settle down\nin. But I soon found that there came such
    a draught of cold air over\nme from under the sill of the window, that this plan
    would never do at\nall, especially as another current from the rickety door met
    the one\nfrom the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds\nin
    the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the\nnight.\n 
    The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I\nsteal a march
    on him- bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not\nto be wakened by the
    most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea but\nupon second thoughts I dismissed
    it. For who could tell but what the\nnext morning, so soon as I popped out of
    the room, the harpooneer\nmight be standing in the entry, all ready to knock
    me down!\n  Still looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\nspending
    a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I began\nto think that
    after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices\nagainst this unknown
    harpooneer. Thinks I, I'll wait awhile; he must\nbe dropping in before long.
    I'll have a good look at him then, and\nperhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows
    after all- there's no\ntelling.\n  But though the other boarders kept coming
    in by ones, twos, and\nthrees, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\n 
    \"Landlord! said I, \"what sort of a chap is he- does he always keep\nsuch late
    hours?\" It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.\n  The landlord chuckled again
    with his lean chuckle, and seemed to\nbe mightily tickled at something beyond
    my comprehension. \"No,\" he\nanswered, \"generally he's an early bird- airley
    to bed and airley to\nrise- yea, he's the bird what catches the worm. But to-night
    he went\nout a peddling, you see, and I don't see what on airth keeps him so\nlate,
    unless, may be, he can't sell his head.\"\n  \"Can't sell his head?- What sort
    of a bamboozingly story is this you\nare telling me?\" getting into a towering
    rage. \"Do you pretend to say,\nlandlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged
    this blessed\nSaturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head\naround
    this town?\"\n  \"That's precisely it,\" said the landlord, \"and I told him
    he\ncouldn't sell it here, the market's overstocked.\"\n  \"With what?\" shouted
    I.\n  \"With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?\"\n 
    \"I tell you what it is, landlord,\" said I quite calmly, \"you'd\nbetter stop
    spinning that yarn to me- I'm not green.\"\n  \"May be not,\" taking out a stick
    and whittling a toothpick, \"but I\nrayther guess you'll be done brown if that
    ere harpooneer hears you\na slanderin' his head.\"\n  \"I'll break it for him,\"
    said I, now flying into a passion again\nat this unaccountable farrago of the
    landlord's.\n  \"It's broke a'ready,\" said he.\n  \"Broke,\" said I- \"broke,
    do you mean?\"\n  \"Sartain, and that's the very reason he can't sell it, I guess.\"\n 
    \"Landlord,\" said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a\nsnowstorm- \"landlord,
    stop whittling. You and I must understand one\nanother, and that too without
    delay. I come to your house and want a\nbed; you tell me you can only give me
    half a one; that the other\nhalf belongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this
    harpooneer,\nwhom I have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most\nmystifying
    and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an\nuncomfortable feeling towards
    the man whom you design for my\nbedfellow- a sort of connexion, landlord, which
    is an intimate and\nconfidential one in the highest degree. I now demand of you
    to speak\nout and tell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall\nbe
    in all respects safe to spend the night with him. And in the\nfirst place, you
    will be so good as to unsay that story about\nselling his head, which if true
    I take to be good evidence that this\nharpooneer is stark mad, and I've no idea
    of sleeping with a madman;\nand you, sir, you I mean, landlord, you, sir, by
    trying to induce me\nto do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable
    to a\ncriminal prosecution.\"\n  \"Wall,\" said the landlord, fetching a long
    breath, \"that's a purty\nlong sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then.
    But be easy,\nbe easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin' you of has just\narrived
    from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of 'balmed New\nZealand heads (great
    curios, you know), and he's sold all on 'em but\none, and that one he's trying
    to sell to-night, cause to-morrow's\nSunday, and it would not do to be sellin'
    human heads about the\nstreets when folks is goin' to churches. He wanted to
    last Sunday, but\nI stopped him just as he was goin' out of the door with four
    heads\nstrung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions.\"\n  This
    account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and\nshowed that the
    landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me-\nbut at the same time what
    could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out\nof a Saturday night clean into
    the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a\ncannibal business as selling the heads of
    dead idolators?\n  \"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous
    man.\"\n  \"He pays reg'lar,\" was the rejoinder. \"But come, it's a nice bed:\nSal
    and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There's\nplenty of room
    for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty big\nbed that. Why, afore
    we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little\nJohnny in the foot of it.
    But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one\nnight, and somehow, Sam got pitched
    on the floor, and came near\nbreaking his arm. Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't
    do. Come along\nhere, I'll give ye a glim in a jiffy;\" and so saying he lighted
    a\ncandle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way. But I stood\nirresolute;
    when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed \"I vum\nit's Sunday- you
    won't see that harpooneer to-night; he's come to\nanchor somewhere- come along
    then; do come; won't ye come?\"\n  I considered the matter a moment, and then
    up stairs we went, and\nI was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and
    furnished, sure\nenough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for
    any four\nharpooneers to sleep abreast.\n  \"There,\" said the landlord, placing
    the candle on a crazy old sea\nchest that did double duty as a wash-stand and
    centre table; \"there,\nmake yourself comfortable now; and good night to ye.\"
    I turned round\nfrom eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\n  Folding back
    the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of\nthe most elegant, it
    yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then\nglanced round the room; and besides
    the bedstead and centre table,\ncould see no other furniture belonging to the
    place, but a rude shelf,\nthe four walls, and a papered fireboard representing
    a man striking\na whale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there
    was a\nhammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a\nlarge
    seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's wardrobe, no doubt\nin lieu of a land
    trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish\nbone fish hooks on the shelf
    over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon\nstanding at the head of the bed.\n 
    But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to\nthe light,
    and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible\nto arrive at some satisfactory
    conclusion concerning it. I can compare\nit to nothing but a large door mat,
    ornamented at the edges with\nlittle tinkling tags something like the stained
    porcupine quills round\nan Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle
    of this\nmat, as you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be\npossible
    that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and\nparade the streets
    of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I\nput it on, to try it, and it
    weighed me down like a hamper, being\nuncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought
    a little damp, as though\nthis mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a
    rainy day. I\nwent up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never\nsaw
    such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry\nthat I gave
    myself a kink in the neck.\n  I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced
    thinking about this\nhead-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking
    some time\non the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then\nstood
    in the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and\nthought a little
    more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel\nvery cold now, half undressed
    as I was, and remembering what the\nlandlord said about the harpooneer's not
    coming home at all that\nnight, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but
    jumped out of my\npantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled
    into bed,\nand commended myself to the care of heaven.\n  Whether that mattress
    was stuffed with corncobs or broken\ncrockery, there is no telling, but I rolled
    about a good deal, and\ncould not sleep for a long time. At last I slid off into
    a light doze,\nand had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod,
    when\nI heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light\ncome
    into the room from under the door.\n  Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the
    harpooneer, the infernal\nhead-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved
    not to say a\nword till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical\nNew
    Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and\nwithout looking
    towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from\nme on the floor in one
    corner, and then began working away at the\nknotted cords of the large bag I
    before spoke of as being in the room.\nI was all eagerness to see his face, but
    he kept it averted for some\ntime while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.
    This accomplished,\nhowever, he turned round- when, good heavens; what a sight!
    Such a\nface! It was of a dark, purplish, yellow color, here and there stuck\nover
    with large blackish looking squares. Yes, it's just as I thought,\nhe's a terrible
    bedfellow; he's been in a fight, got dreadfully cut,\nand here he is, just from
    the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced\nto turn his face so towards the light,
    that I plainly saw they could\nnot be sticking-plasters at all, those black squares
    on his cheeks.\nThey were stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what
    to\nmake of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I\nremembered
    a story of a white man- a whaleman too- who, falling\namong the cannibals, had
    been tattooed by them. I concluded that\nthis harpooneer, in the course of his
    distant voyages, must have met\nwith a similar adventure. And what is it, thought
    I, after all! It's\nonly his outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin.
    But then,\nwhat to make of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean,\nlying
    round about, and completely independent of the squares of\ntattooing. To be sure,
    it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical\ntanning; but I never heard of
    a hot sun's tanning a white man into a\npurplish yellow one. However, I had never
    been in the South Seas;\nand perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary
    effects upon\nthe skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like\nlightning,
    this harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some\ndifficulty having opened
    his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and\npresently pulled out a sort of tomahawk,
    and a seal-skin wallet with\nthe hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the
    middle of a room,\nhe then took the New Zealand head- a ghastly thing enough-
    and crammed\nit down into the bag. He now took off his hat- a new beaver hat-\nwhen
    I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise. There was no hair on\nhis head-
    none to speak of at least- nothing but a small scalp-knot\ntwisted up on his
    forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for\nall the world like a mildewed
    skull. Had not the stranger stood\nbetween me and the door, I would have bolted
    out of it quicker than\never I bolted a dinner.\n  Even as it was, I thought
    something of slipping out of the window,\nbut it was the second floor back. I
    am no coward, but what to make\nof this headpeddling purple rascal altogether
    passed my comprehension.\nIgnorance is the parent of fear, and being completely
    nonplussed and\nconfounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid
    of\nhim as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at\nthe
    dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game\nenough just
    then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer\nconcerning what seemed
    inexplicable in him.\n  Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and
    at last\nshowed his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him\nwere
    checkered with the same squares as his face, his back, too, was\nall over the
    same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty\nYears' War, and just escaped
    from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.\nStill more, his very legs were marked,
    as a parcel of dark green frogs\nwere running up the trunks of young palms. It
    was now quite plain that\nhe must be some abominable savage or other shipped
    aboard of a\nwhaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country.
    I\nquaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too- perhaps the heads of\nhis own
    brothers. He might take a fancy to mine- heavens! look at that\ntomahawk!\n 
    But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went\nabout something
    that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced\nme that he must indeed
    be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or\nwrapall, or dreadnaught, which he
    had previously hung on a chair, he\nfumbled in the pockets, and produced at length
    a curious little\ndeformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the color
    of a\nthree days' old Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first\nI
    almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved\nsome similar
    manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and\nthat it glistened a good
    deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it\nmust be nothing but a wooden idol,
    which indeed it proved to be. For\nnow the savage goes up to the empty fire-place,
    and removing the\npapered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image,
    like a\ntenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks\ninside
    were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a\nvery appropriate little
    shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\n  I now screwed my eyes hard towards the
    half hidden image, feeling\nbut ill at ease meantime- to see what was next to
    follow. First he\ntakes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket,\nand
    places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship\nbiscuit on
    top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the\nshavings into a sacrificial
    blaze. Presently, after many hasty\nsnatches into the fire, and still hastier
    withdrawals of his fingers\n(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he
    at last succeeded\nin drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and
    ashes a\nlittle, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro. But the\nlittle
    devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he\nnever moved his
    lips. All these strange antics were accompanied by\nstill stranger guttural noises
    from the devotee, who seemed to be\npraying in a sing-song or else singing some
    pagan psalmody or other,\nduring which his face twitched about in the most unnatural
    manner.\nAt last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very\nunceremoniously,
    and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly\nas if he were a sportsman
    bagging a dead woodcock.\n  All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness,
    and\nseeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\noperations,
    and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high\ntime, now or never, before
    the light was put out, to break the spell\nin which I had so long been bound.\n 
    But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal\none. Taking
    up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it\nfor an instant, and
    then holding it to the light, with his mouth at\nthe handle, he puffed out great
    clouds of tobacco smoke. The next\nmoment the light was extinguished, and this
    wild cannibal, tomahawk\nbetween his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out,
    I could not\nhelp it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began\nfeeling
    me.\n  Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\nagainst
    the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he\nmight be, to keep quiet,
    and let me get up and light the lamp again.\nBut his guttural responses satisfied
    me at once that he but ill\ncomprehended my meaning.\n  \"Who-e debel you?\"-
    he at last said- \"you no speak-e, dam-me, I\nkill-e.\" And so saying the lighted
    tomahawk began flourishing about me\nin the dark.\n  \"Landlord, for God's sake,
    Peter Coffin!\" shouted I. \"Landlord!\nWatch! Coffin! Angels! save me!\"\n 
    \"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!\" again\ngrowled the cannibal,
    while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk\nscattered the hot tobacco ashes
    about me till I thought my linen would\nget on fire. But thank heaven, at that
    moment the landlord came into\nthe room light in hand, and leaping from the bed
    I ran up to him.\n  \"Don't be afraid now,\" said he, grinning again, \"Queequeg
    here\nwouldn't harm a hair of your head.\"\n  \"Stop your grinning,\" shouted
    I, \"and why didn't you tell me that\nthat infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?\"\n 
    \"I thought ye know'd it;- didn't I tell ye, he was a peddlin'\nheads around
    town?- but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg,\nlook here- you sabbee
    me, I sabbee- you this man sleepe you- you\nsabbee?\"\n  \"Me sabbee plenty\"-
    grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and\nsitting up in bed.\n  \"You gettee
    in,\" he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\nthrowing the clothes
    to one side. He really did this in not only a\ncivil but a really kind and charitable
    way. I stood looking at him a\nmoment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole
    a clean, comely\nlooking cannibal. What's all this fuss I have been making about,\nthought
    I to myself- the man's a human being just as I am: he has just\nas much reason
    to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep\nwith a sober cannibal
    than a drunken Christian.\n  \"Landlord,\" said I, \"tell him to stash his tomahawk
    there, or\npipe, or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short,
    and\nI will turn in with him. But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed\nwith
    me. It's dangerous. Besides, I ain't insured.\"\n  This being told to Queequeg,
    he at once complied, and again politely\nmotioned me to get into bed- rolling
    over to one side as much as to\nsay- I won't touch a leg of ye.\"\n  \"Good night,
    landlord,\" said I, \"you may go.\"\n  I turned in, and never slept better in
    my life.\n  "
