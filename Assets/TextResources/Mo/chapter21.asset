  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 22,   Merry Christmas
  content: "\n  In the same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman's Chapel, and few\nare
    the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or\nPacific, who fail
    to make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I\ndid not.\n  Returning from
    my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon\nthis special errand. The sky
    had changed from clear, sunny cold, to\ndriving sleet and mist. Wrapping myself
    in my shaggy jacket of the\ncloth called bearskin, I fought my way against the
    stubborn storm.\nEntering, I found a small scattered congregation of sailors,
    and\nsailors' wives and widows. A muffled silence reigned, only broken at\ntimes
    by the shrieks of the storm. Each silent worshipper seemed\npurposely sitting
    apart from the other, as if each silent grief were\ninsular and incommunicable.
    The chaplain had not yet arrived; and\nthere these silent islands of men and
    women sat steadfastly eyeing\nseveral marble tablets, with black borders, masoned
    into the wall on\neither side the pulpit. Three of them ran something like the\nfollowing,
    but I do not pretend to quote:\n\n                            SACRED\n                       
    TO THE MEMORY\n                              OF\n                          JOHN
    TALBOT,\n        Who, at the age of eighteen, was lost overboard\n          Near
    the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia,\n                       November 1st,
    1836.\n                          THIS TABLET\n                   Is erected to
    his Memory\n                         BY HIS SISTER.\n\n                           
    SACRED\n                        TO THE MEMORY\n                             
    OF\n                  ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY,\n            NATHAN COLEMAN,

    Forming one of the boats' crews\n                              OF\n                      
    THE SHIP ELIZA\n             Who were towed out of sight by a Whale,\n                 
    On the Off-shore Ground in the\n                           PACIFIC,\n                     
    December 31st, 1839.\n                          THIS MARBLE\n               Is
    here placed by their surviving\n                           SHIPMATES.\n\n                           
    SACRED\n                        TO THE MEMORY\n                             
    OF\n                           The late\n                    CAPTAIN EZEKIEL
    HARDY,\n          Who in the bows of his boat was killed by a\n              
    Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan,\n                       August 3d, 1833.\n                         
    THIS TABLET\n                   Is erected to his Memory\n                             
    BY\n                          HIS WIDOW.\n\n  Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed
    hat and jacket, I seated\nmyself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised
    to see\nQueequeg near me. Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was\na
    wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This\nsavage was
    the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance;\nbecause he was the
    only one who could not read, and, therefore, was\nnot reading those frigid inscriptions
    on the wall. Whether any of\nthe relatives of the seamen whose names appeared
    there were now\namong the congregation, I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded\naccidents
    in the fishery, and so plainly did several women present\nwear the countenance
    if not the trappings of some unceasing grief,\nthat I feel sure that here before
    me were assembled those, in whose\nunhealing hearts the sight of those bleak
    tablets sympathetically\ncaused the old wounds to bleed afresh.\n  Oh! ye whose
    dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing\namong flowers can say-
    here, here lies my beloved; ye know not the\ndesolation that broods in bosoms
    like these. What bitter blanks in\nthose black-bordered marbles which cover no
    ashes! What despair in\nthose immovable inscriptions! What deadly voids and unbidden\ninfidelities
    in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse\nresurrections to the
    beings who have placelessly perished without a\ngrave. As well might those tablets
    stand in the cave of Elephanta as\nhere.\n  In what census of living creatures,
    the dead of mankind are\nincluded; why it is that a universal proverb says of
    them, that they\ntell no tales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin\nSands!
    how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other\nworld, we prefix
    so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not\nthus entitle him, if he but
    embarks for the remotest Indies of this\nliving earth; why the Life Insurance
    Companies pay death-forfeitures\nupon immortals; in what eternal, unstirring
    paralysis, and deadly,\nhopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam who died sixty
    round\ncenturies ago; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for\nthose
    who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable\nbliss; why all the
    living so strive to hush all the dead; wherefore\nbut the rumor of a knocking
    in a tomb will terrify a whole city. All\nthese things are not without their
    meanings.\n  But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these\ndead
    doubts she gathers her most vital hope.\n  It needs scarcely to be told, with
    what feelings, on the eve of a\nNantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets,
    and by the murky\nlight of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen\nwho
    had gone before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine.\nBut somehow I
    grew merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine\nchance for promotion,
    it seems- aye, a stove boat will make me an\nimmortal by brevet. Yes, there is
    death in this business of whaling- a\nspeechlessly quick chaotic bundling of
    a man into Eternity. But what\nthen? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter
    of Life and\nDeath. Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my
    true\nsubstance. Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too\nmuch
    like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking\nthat thick water
    the thinnest of air. Methinks my body is but the lees\nof my better being. In
    fact take my body who will, take it I say, it\nis not me. And therefore three
    cheers for Nantucket; and come a\nstove boat and stove body when they will, for
    stave my soul, Jove\nhimself cannot.\n  "
