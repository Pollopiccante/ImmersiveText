  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 46,   Surmises
  content: "\n  It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly
    to\nanchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no\nbusiness
    that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The\nlandlord of the Spouter-Inn
    had recommended us to his cousin Hosea\nHussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted
    to be the proprietor of one\nof the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover
    he had\nassured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his\nchowders.
    In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do\nbetter than try pot-luck
    at the Try Pots. But the directions hc had\ngiven us about keeping a yellow warehouse
    on our starboard hand till\nwe opened a white church to the larboard, and then
    keeping that on the\nlarboard hand till we made a corner three points to the
    starboard, and\nthat done, then ask the first man we met where the place was;
    these\ncrooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially\nas,
    at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse- our\nfirst point
    of departure- must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I\nhad understood Peter
    Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However,\nby dint of beating about a little
    in the dark, and now and then\nknocking up a peaceful inhabitant to inquire the
    way, we at last\ncame to something which there was no mistaking.\n  Two enormous
    wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses'\nears, swung from the cross-trees
    of an old top-mast, planted in\nfront of an old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees
    were sawed off\non the other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little\nlike
    a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at\nthe time, but
    I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague\nmisgiving. A sort of crick
    was in my neck as I gazed up to the two\nremaining horns; yes, two of them, one
    for Queequeg, and one for me.\nIt's ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper
    upon landing in my first\nwhaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen's
    chapel, and\nhere a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these\nlast
    throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?\n  I was called from these reflections
    by the sight of a freckled woman\nwith yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing
    in the porch of the\ninn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much
    like an\ninjured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple\nwoollen
    shirt.\n  \"Get along with ye,\" said she to the man, \"or I'll be combing ye!\"\n 
    \"Come on, Queequeg,\" said I, \"all right. There's Mrs. Hussey.\"\n  And so
    it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but\nleaving Mrs. Hussey entirely
    competent to attend to all his affairs.\nUpon making known our desires for a
    supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,\npostponing further scolding for the present,
    ushered us into a\nlittle room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics
    of a\nrecently concluded repast, turned round to us and said- \"Clam or Cod?\"\n 
    \"What's that about Cods, ma'am?\" said I, with much politeness.\n  \"Clam or
    Cod?\" she repeated.\n  \"A clam for supper? a cold clam; is that what you mean,
    Mrs.\nHussey?\" says I, \"but that's a rather cold and clammy reception in the\nwinter
    time, ain't it, Mrs. Hussey?\"\n  But being in a great hurry to resume scolding
    the man in the\npurple shirt who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming
    to\nhear nothing but the word \"clam,\" Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an\nopen
    door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out \"clam for two,\"\ndisappeared.\n 
    \"Queequeg,\" said I, \"do you think that we can make a supper for us\nboth on
    one clam?\"\n  However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie
    the\napparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder\ncame
    in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh! sweet friends,\nhearken to me.
    It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger\nthan hazel nuts, mixed with
    pounded ship biscuits, and salted pork cut\nup into little flakes! the whole
    enriched with butter, and plentifully\nseasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites
    being sharpened by the\nfrosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his
    favourite\nfishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent,\nwe
    despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and\nbethinking
    me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod announcement, I thought\nI would try a little
    experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I\nuttered the word \"cod\" with great
    emphasis, and resumed my seat. In\na few moments the savoury steam came forth
    again, but with a different\nflavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was
    placed before us.\n  We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the
    bowl, thinks\nI to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head?\nWhat's
    that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? \"But look,\nQueequeg, ain't
    that a live eel in your bowl? Where's your harpoon?\"\n  Fishiest of all fishy
    places was the Try Pots, which well deserved\nits name; for the pots there were
    always boiling chowders. Chowder for\nbreakfast, and chowder for dinner, and
    chowder for supper, till you\nbegan to look for fish-bones coming through your
    clothes. The area\nbefore the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore
    a\npolished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his\naccount books
    bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy\nflavor to the milk, too,
    which I could not at all account for, till\none morning happening to take a stroll
    along the beach among some\nfishermen's boats, I saw Hosea's brindled cow feeding
    on fish\nremnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod's\ndecapitated
    head, looking very slipshod, I assure ye.\n  Supper concluded, we received a
    lamp, and directions from Mrs.\nHussey concerning the nearest way to bed; but,
    as Queequeg was about\nto precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her
    arm, and\ndemanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. \"Why\nnot?
    said I; \"every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon- but why\nnot?\" \"Because
    it's dangerous,\" says she. \"Ever since young Stiggs\ncoming from that unfort'nt
    v'y'ge of his, when he was gone four\nyears and a half, with only three barrels
    of ile, was found dead in my\nfirst floor back, with his harpoon in his side;
    ever since then I\nallow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their
    rooms at\nnight. So, Mr. Queequeg\" (for she had learned his name), \"I will\njust
    take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning. But the\nchowder; clam
    or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?\"\n  \"Both,\" says I; \"and let's have
    a couple of smoked herring by way of\nvariety.\"\n  "
