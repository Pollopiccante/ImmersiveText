  chapterTitle: CHAPTER 85,   The Fountain
  content: "\n  For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches\nwas
    seen of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at\nthe watches,
    and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they\nseemed to be the only
    commanders of the ship; only they sometimes\nissued from the cabin with orders
    so sudden and peremptory, that after\nall it was plain they but commanded vicariously.
    Yet, their supreme\nlord and dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any
    eyes not\npermitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.\n 
    Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly\ngazed aft
    to mark if any strange face was visible; for my first\nvague disquietude touching
    the unknown captain, now in the seclusion\nof the sea became almost a perturbation.
    This was strangely heightened\nat times by the ragged Elijah's diabolical incoherences
    uninvitedly\nrecurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before\nconceived
    of. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other\nmoods I was almost ready
    to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that\noutlandish prophet of the wharves.
    But whatever it was of\napprehensiveness or uneasiness- to call it so- which
    I felt, yet\nwhenever I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed against
    all\nwarranty to cherish such emotions. For though the harpooneers, with\nthe
    great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric, heathenish,\nand motley set
    than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which my\nprevious experiences had
    made me acquainted with, still I ascribed\nthis- and rightly ascribed it- to
    the fierce uniqueness of the very\nnature of that wild Scandinavian vocation
    in which I had so\nabandonedly embarked. But it was especially the aspect of
    the three\nchief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly\ncalculated
    to allay these colorless misgivings, and induce\nconfidence and cheerfulness
    in every presentment of the voyage.\nThree better, more likely sea-officers and
    men, each in his own\ndifferent way, could not readily be found, and they were
    every one\nof them Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it\nbeing
    Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we\nhad biting
    Polar weather, though all the time running away from it\nto the southward; and
    by every degree and minute of latitude which\nwe sailed, gradually leaving that
    merciless winter, and all its\nintolerable weather behind us. It was one of those
    less lowering,\nbut still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition,
    when with\na fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive\nsort
    of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck\nat the call
    of the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance\ntowards the taffrail,
    foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran\napprehension; Captain Ahab stood
    upon his quarter-deck.\n  There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about
    him, nor of\nthe recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake,\nwhen
    the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming\nthem, or taking
    away one particle from their compacted aged\nrobustness. His whole high, broad
    form, seemed made of solid bronze,\nand shaped in an unalterable mould, like
    Cellini's cast Perseus.\nThreading its way out from among his grey hairs, and
    continuing\nright down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it\ndisappeared
    in his clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark,\nlividly whitish. It resembled
    that perpendicular seam sometimes made\nin the straight, lofty trunk of a great
    tree, when the upper lightning\ntearingly darts down it, and without wrenching
    a single twig, peels\nand grooves out the bark from top to bottom ere running
    off into the\nsoil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded. Whether\nthat
    mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some\ndesperate wound,
    no one could certainly say. By some tacit consent,\nthroughout the voyage little
    or no allusion was made to it, especially\nby the mates. But once Tashtego's
    senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among\nthe crew, superstitiously asserted that
    not till he was full forty\nyears old did Ahab become that way branded, and then
    it came upon him,\nnot in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife
    at sea.\nYet, this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey\nManxman
    insinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before\nsailed out of Nantucket,
    had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab.\nNevertheless, the old sea-traditions,
    the immemorial credulities,\npopularly invested this old Manxman with preternatural
    powers of\ndiscernment. So that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when\nhe
    said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out- which\nmight hardly
    come to pass, so he muttered- then, whoever should do\nthat last office for the
    dead, would find a birth-mark on him from\ncrown to sole.\n  So powerfully did
    the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the\nlivid brand which streaked
    it, that for the first few moments I hardly\nnoted that not a little of this
    overbearing grimness was owing to\nthe barbaric white leg upon which he partly
    stood. It had previously\ncome to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned
    from the\npolished bone of the sperm whale's jaw. \"Aye, he was dismasted off\nJapan,\"
    said the old Gay-Head Indian once; \"but like his dismasted\ncraft, he shipped
    another mast without coming home for it. He has a\nquiver of 'em.\"\n  I was
    struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side\nof the Pequod's
    quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen\nshrouds, there was an auger hole,
    bored about half an inch or so, into\nthe plank. His bone leg steadied in that
    hole; one arm elevated, and\nholding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking
    straight out\nbeyond the ship's ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of
    firmest\nfortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and\nfearless,
    forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke;\nnor did his officers
    say aught to him; though by all their minutest\ngestures and expressions, they
    plainly showed the uneasy, if not\npainful, consciousness of being under a troubled
    master-eye. And not\nonly that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with
    a\ncrucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity\nof
    some mighty woe.\n  Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into
    his\ncabin. But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew;\neither
    standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he\nhad; or heavily
    walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed,\nbegan to grow a little
    genial, he became still less and less a\nrecluse; as if, when the ship had sailed
    from home, nothing but the\ndead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him
    so secluded. And,\nby and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually
    in the air;\nbut, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at\nlast
    sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But\nthe Pequod was
    only making a passage now; not regularly cruising;\nnearly all whaling preparatives
    needing supervision the mates were\nfully competent to, so that there was little
    or nothing, out of\nhimself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away,
    for\nthat one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon\nhis
    brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile\nthemselves upon.\n 
    Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\npleasant, holiday
    weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him\nfrom his mood. For, as when
    the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April\nand May, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic
    woods; even the barest,\nruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least
    send forth some\nfew green sprouts, to welcome such gladhearted visitants; so
    Ahab did,\nin the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that\ngirlish
    air. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a\nlook, which, in
    any other man, would have soon flowered out in a\nsmile.\n  "
